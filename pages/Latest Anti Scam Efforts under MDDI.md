<p><em>Figures for 1 Jan – 31 Dec 2024</em>
</p>
<h3>Initiatives by the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA)</h3>
<h4>Blocking of commonly spoofed local numbers, robocalls, scam SMSes and scam-related links via SMS</h4>
<p>IMDA has partnered with telcos to implement a suite of anti-scam measures
that strengthen safeguards for the public against scams coming through
the telecommunication networks.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Since 2019, telcos have been blocking commonly spoofed local trusted numbers,
such as emergency hotlines and government agencies. In addition, telcos
have been blocking reported SMSes and scam links sent via SMS to Singapore
users.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subsequently in 2020, telcos also blocked robocalls using pattern recognition
technology.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>IMDA also worked with the telcos and the police, to further tighten SIM
card registration processes and strengthen accountability for SIM cards,
minimising criminal exploitation. From April 2024, a limit of 10 postpaid
SIM cards per subscriber has been put in place.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Feature to block international calls and SMSes</h4>
<p>Recognising that many of these scam calls/SMSes come from overseas sources,
IMDA worked with the telcos to introduce features for subscribers to block
all incoming calls and/or SMSes from international numbers on their mobile
phones.</p>
<p>To date, over 287,000 subscribers have activated the feature to block
calls from international numbers, while over 219,000 subscribers have activated
the feature to block SMS from international numbers. This same feature
to block calls from international numbers has since been extended to residential
fixed lines for subscribers of major telco operators in Singapore progressively
since December 2024.</p>
<h4>SMS Sender ID Registry (SSIR) regime</h4>
<p>In 2023, IMDA implemented the full Singapore SMS Sender ID Registry (SSIR)
regime where non-registered SMS Sender IDs will be labelled as “Likely-SCAM’,
to alert consumers to exercise caution when dealing with them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the implementation of the SSIR, the number of SMS scam cases has
declined by almost 80% from 1484 in Q4 2021 to 307 in Q4 2024. As of January
2025, over 4,000 organisations had registered with SSIR; they account for
over 97% of all commercial SMS traffic in Singapore.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Initiatives by the Cybersecurity Agency of Singapore (CSA)</h3>
<h4>Enhanced Fraud Protection with Google</h4>
<p>In February 2024, CSA partnered Google on a pilot for Enhanced Fraud Protection
(EFP) within Google Play Protect in Singapore. This feature automatically
blocks the installation of potentially malicious apps that use sensitive
runtime permissions. As of December 2024, the EFP feature has successfully
blocked 1.6 million installation attempts of potentially malicious applications
across nearly 400,000 devices. This prevented 25,000 unique apps from potentially
being misused for financial fraud and scams. This feature is now being
rolled out in other countries by Google, protecting citizens beyond Singapore.</p>
<h4>Safe App Standard 2.0</h4>
<p>Developed in consultation with industry stakeholders, CSA published its
second version of the Safe App Standard (SAS) in October 2024. SAS 2.0
is a comprehensive guide for mobile app developers in Singapore, to enhance
security measures for apps which carry a financial transaction feature.
Its primary objective is to ensure that baseline security standards are
met, to mitigate against the risk of financial frauds and foster trust
within Singapore's mobile system.</p>

<h3>Initiatives by the Government Technology Agency of Singapore (GovTech)</h3>
<h4>Scam Analytics and Tactical Intervention System (SATIS)</h4>
<p>GovTech, in partnership with the Singapore Police Force and the Home Team
Science and Technology Agency, jointly developed the Scam Analytics and
Tactical Intervention System (SATIS), which leverages artificial intelligence
and machine learning to triage, assess and disrupt scam-related websites
swiftly. Additional capabilities were added to the SATIS suite of products
to disrupt online monikers, with planned improvements to disrupt other
scam enablers such as payment channels and mobile numbers.</p>
<p>In 2024, the Singapore Government was able to disrupt more than 57,700
mobile lines, more than 40,500 WhatsApp lines, more than 33,600 online
monikers and advertisements, and more than 44,900 websites that were scam-related.
This is a significant increase in disruptions as compared to 2023, and
was made possible through collaborations with online platforms.</p>

<h3>Initiatives by Open Government Products (OGP)</h3>
<h4>Enhanced ScamShield App</h4>
<p>OGP enhanced the ScamShield App in August 2024 to expand ScamShield’s
protection from passive to active to combat emerging scam variants, so
as to enable users to protect themselves by actively checking suspicious
messages, calls and websites occurring on third-party platforms such as
WhatsApp and Telegram. The enhanced app simplifies reporting, for more
crowdsourced data to improve scam protection and scam intelligence, which
in turn improve our classifier performance to make sure scam calls and
SMSes are detected accurately.</p>
<p>Since the enhanced app was launched, there has been a 32% growth in the
app user base from 900,000 to 1.19 million users currently. More than 194,000
activated users have used the “Check for Scams” or “Report a Scam” feature
at least once and have rated the app an average of 4.67/5 for in-app satisfaction.</p>
<h4>Single SMS Sender ID <strong>gov.sg</strong> for all government agencies</h4>
<p>Since 1 July 2024, the Singapore Government has implemented a single SMS
Sender ID, <strong>gov.sg</strong> for all government agencies. This replaces
individual government agency Sender IDs. The change aims to help the public
easily identify genuine government SMS communications and protect against
government officials impersonation scams.</p>
