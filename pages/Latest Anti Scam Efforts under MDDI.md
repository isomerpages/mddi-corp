<h2>Initiatives under MDDI agencies</h2>
<h3>Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA)</h3>
<h4>Blocking of commonly spoofed local numbers, robocalls, scam SMSes and scam-related links via SMS</h4>
<p>IMDA has partnered with telcos to implement a suite of anti-scam measures
that strengthen safeguards for the public against scams coming through
the telecommunication networks.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Since 2019, telcos have been blocking commonly spoofed local trusted numbers,
such as emergency hotlines and government agencies. In addition, telcos
have been blocking reported SMSes and scam links sent via SMS to Singapore
users.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subsequently in 2020, telcos also blocked robocalls using pattern recognition
technology.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>IMDA also worked with the telcos and the police, to further tighten SIM
card registration processes and strengthen accountability for SIM cards,
minimising criminal exploitation. From April 2024, a limit of 10 postpaid
SIM cards per subscriber has been put in place.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Feature to block international calls and SMSes</h4>
<p>Recognising that many of these scam calls/SMSes come from overseas sources,
IMDA worked with the telcos to introduce features for subscribers to block
all incoming calls and/or SMSes from international numbers on their mobile
phones.</p>
<p>To date, over 287,000 subscribers have activated the feature to block
calls from international numbers, while over 219,000 subscribers have activated
the feature to block SMS from international numbers. This same feature
to block calls from international numbers has since been extended to residential
fixed lines for subscribers of major telco operators in Singapore progressively
since December 2024.</p>
<h4>SMS Sender ID Registry (SSIR) regime</h4>
<p>In 2023, IMDA implemented the full Singapore SMS Sender ID Registry (SSIR)
regime where non-registered SMS Sender IDs will be labelled as “Likely-SCAM’,
to alert consumers to exercise caution when dealing with them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the implementation of the SSIR, the number of SMS scam cases has
declined by almost 80% from 1484 in Q4 2021 to 307 in Q4 2024. As of January
2025, over 4,000 organisations had registered with SSIR; they account for
over 97% of all commercial SMS traffic in Singapore.&nbsp;</p>
