### Work Passes

Foreigners who intend to work in Singapore must have a valid work pass (commonly known as a work visa) before they start work. Please visit the [Ministry of Manpower (MOM)’s website](https://www.mom.gov.sg/passes-and-permits) for more information on the various types of work pass, eligibility criteria, and application process.    
  
Foreign media personnel on short-term assignments (up to 60 days) which are not supported or sponsored by any Singapore government agency are required to apply for a Miscellaneous Work Pass (MWP) via MOM’s [website](http://www.mom.gov.sg/passes-and-permits/miscellaneous-work-pass/apply-for-a-pass).   
  
For enquiries on work pass matters, please contact MOM’s Work Pass Division at [mom\_wpd@mom.gov.sg](mailto:mom_wpd@mom.gov.sg)
