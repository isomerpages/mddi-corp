<h2>Paving the Way Towards Our Digital Future</h2>
<p>“A Smart Nation that we can trust, helps us grow, and keeps us together”</p>
<p>Today, Singaporeans embrace the use of digital technologies in their daily
lives. Many are also open to trying out new technologies. The Ministry
of Communications and Information (MCI) will create a trusted environment
where Singaporeans can use technology with confidence and continue to benefit
from developments in technology.</p>
<p>At the Committee of Supply 2024 debates, MCI outlines plans to pave the
way towards our digital future. Through Artificial Intelligence (AI) initiatives
to power Singapore’s next bound of economic growth, the development of
our digital infrastructure, and measures to strengthen Singaporeans’ trust
and confidence in the digital domain, we hope everyone can thrive in our
digital future.</p>
<h3>Uplift Economic Potential Through Digital</h3>
<p>The Government will invest more than S$1 billion over the next five years
into AI compute, talent, and industry development. MCI will build capabilities
in our people and businesses to seize opportunities in an AI-enabled future.</p>

<h3>Preserve Trust in The Digital &amp; Information Domains</h3>
<p>Singaporeans depend on the digital infrastructure and services that meet
their day-to-day needs and power our digital economy. To preserve trust
in our digital domain, MCI will enhance the resilience of Singapore's digital
infrastructure and services, foster an environment where AI will be used
responsibly and ethically, and strengthen Public Service Media to guard
against rising threats of misinformation.</p>
