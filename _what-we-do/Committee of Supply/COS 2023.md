<h2>Empowering Singaporeans to Thrive in Our Digital Future</h2>
<p>Digital technologies have become an essential part of our everyday lives.
The Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI) is committed to strengthening
our digital social compact by keeping people at the core of its efforts.</p>
<p>At the Committee of Supply 2023 debates, MCI outlined our plans to create
a safe and inclusive digital society for all Singaporeans. Through the
development of our digital infrastructure and providing Singaporeans with
access to tools to navigate the digital world, we hope to empower everyone
to thrive in our shared digital future.</p>

<h3>Trust &amp; Safety: Helping Singaporeans Go Online with Confidence</h3>
<p>As Singapore strives towards our digitalisation ambitions, we need an
environment that is trusted and safe to live, work and play in. To realise
this, we will need to ensure digital inclusion even as we keep the online
space a safe platform for everyone.</p>
