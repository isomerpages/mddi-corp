<h2>What we do</h2>
<p>MDDI, formerly known as MCI until 7 July 2024, uses a wide range of evidence-based
research methods to better understand public sentiment, attitudes and behaviour
through a data-driven approach. These research insights help the Government
better assess public awareness of, and response to, specific government
policies and programmes.</p>
<p>We are method-neutral in conducting our research, employing a range of
tools including:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Surveys (e.g. door-to-door, telephone, online)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Focus group discussions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Behavioural insights</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Media consumption analytics</p>
</li>
</ul>
