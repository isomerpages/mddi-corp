## What we do

MCI uses a wide range of evidence-based research methods to better understand public sentiment, attitudes and behaviour through a data-driven approach. These research insights help the Government better assess public awareness of, and response to, specific government policies and programmes.Â 

We are method-neutral in conducting our research, employing a range of tools including:

*   Surveys (e.g. door-to-door, telephone, online)
*   Focus group discussions
*   Behavioural insights
*   Media consumption analytics
