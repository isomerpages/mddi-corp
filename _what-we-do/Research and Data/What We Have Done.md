<h2>What we have done</h2>
<p>Some examples of research that MDDI, formerly known as MCI, has done include:</p>
<p><strong>Understanding Singapore Residents’ Overall Quality of Life Post- Pandemic</strong>
</p>
<p>Comparing Quality of Life Now Compared to Pre-COVID</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Most (72%) Singapore residents felt that their overall quality of life
was the same or better in 2023, compared to 2019 (pre-pandemic).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>69% Singapore residents rated their overall quality of their lives as
“Good” or “Very Good”.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even among those (28%) who felt that their overall quality of life was
worse compared to before the pandemic, when asked to rate 10 aspects of
their current lives, at least 6 in 10 rated them same or higher. This is
suggestive of a general recovery.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Vulnerable Segments</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>A higher proportion of youths aged 15 to 19 years reported a drop in their
quality of life (38% for youths vs. 28% for the general population), as
well as their ability to manage their mental health (37% for youths vs.
28% for the general population), compared to before the pandemic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This suggests that the impact of COVID-19 restrictions on social activities
was more keenly felt by the young, especially teenagers.</p>

<p><strong>Understanding Singaporeans’ Digital Readiness</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Most agreed that technology made their lives better, but fewer were keen to try out new technologies.</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>84% agreed that digital technologies made their lives easier.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This was so even among seniors aged 70 years old and above, where a majority
(62%) of them agreed that digital technologies made their lives easier.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, only 65% were keen to try out new digital technologies.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>A Growing Digital Proficiency</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Overall, 68% had basic or higher than basic or higher than basic digital
proficiency, from 59% in 2020.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For seniors in their 70s and above, the biggest improvement was from the
low to developing proficiency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>29% of seniors in their 70s and above had developing proficiency in 2022,
compared to 7% in 2020.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Meanwhile, the proportion of seniors 70s and above with low proficiency
dropped from 80% in 2020, to about 54% of seniors in in 2022.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While seniors saw a more modest improvement, the direction and development
are encouraging signs of progress made in this area.</p>
