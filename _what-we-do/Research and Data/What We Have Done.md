## What we have done

Some examples of research that MCI has done include:

**Understanding Singapore Residents’ Overall Quality of Life Post- Pandemic**

Comparing Quality of Life Now Compared to Pre-COVID
*   Most (72%) Singapore residents felt that their overall quality of life was the same or better in 2023, compared to 2019 (pre-pandemic).  
*   69% Singapore residents rated their overall quality of their lives as “Good” or “Very Good”. 
*   Even among those (28%) who felt that their overall quality of life was worse compared to before the pandemic, when asked to rate 10 aspects of their current lives, at least 6 in 10 rated them same or higher. This is suggestive of a general recovery. 

Vulnerable Segments
*   A higher proportion of youths aged 15 to 19 years reported a drop in their quality of life (38% for youths vs. 28% for the general population), as well as their ability to manage their mental health (37% for youths vs. 28% for the general population), compared to before the pandemic. 
*   This suggests that the impact of COVID-19 restrictions on social activities was more keenly felt by the young, especially teenagers.

**Understanding Singaporeans’ Digital Readiness**

**Most agreed that technology made their lives better, but fewer were keen to try out new technologies.** 
*   84% agreed that digital technologies made their lives easier.
*   This was so even among seniors aged 70 years old and above, where a majority (62%) of them agreed that digital technologies made their lives easier.
*   However, only 65% were keen to try out new digital technologies.

**A Growing Digital Proficiency** 
*   Overall, 68% had basic or higher than basic or higher than basic digital proficiency, from 59% in 2020.
*   For seniors in their 70s and above, the biggest improvement was from the low to developing proficiency.
*   29% of seniors in their 70s and above had developing proficiency in 2022, compared to 7% in 2020. 
*   Meanwhile, the proportion of seniors 70s and above with low proficiency dropped from 80% in 2020, to about 54% of seniors in in 2022.
*   While seniors saw a more modest improvement, the direction and development are encouraging signs of progress made in this area.
