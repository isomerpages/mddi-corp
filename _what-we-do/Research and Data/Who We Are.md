## Who we are

MCI conducts Sentiments and Behavioural Research (SBR) to inform policy-making and implementation of key issues across Whole of Government. SBR refers to quantitative, qualitative and/or behavioural insights research that seek to understand how people think about issues, current affairs and policies.

Our research is structured around key focal areas ranging from social, economic, security, infrastructure, to communications- and media-related issues.
