<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.sgtranslatetogether.gov.sg/">SG Translate Together (SGTT)</a> Web Portal allows members of the public to generate localised first-cut translations and contribute post-edited translation data to improve the accuracy of the SG Translate Machine Translation (MT) engine. This engine was jointly developed by the Ministry of Digital Development and Information (MDDI) and A*STAR’s Institute for Infocomm Research (I<sup>2</sup>R), with the support of the TRANS Grant. </li>
<li>The registered users, known as Citizen Translators, can edit the MT generated translations and submit them for review. These reviewed translations will be used to further train the MT engine.</li>
<li>The portal serves as a one-stop platform for the translation community, where they can develop their translation skills, utilise translation resources, share their insights with one another and stay updated on translation-related programmes and events.</li>
