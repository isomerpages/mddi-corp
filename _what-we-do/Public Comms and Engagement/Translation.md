&nbsp;

<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.sgtranslatetogether.gov.sg/">SG Translate Together (SGTT)</a> Web Portal allows members of the public to generate localised first-cut translations and contribute post-edited translation data to improve the accuracy of the SG Translate Machine Translation (MT) engine. This engine was jointly developed by the Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI) and A*STAR’s Institute for Infocomm Research (I<sup>2</sup>R), with the support of the TRANS Grant. </li>
<li>The registered users, known as Citizen Translators, can edit the MT generated translations and submit them for review. These reviewed translations will be used to further train the MT engine.</li>
<li>The portal serves as a one-stop platform for the translation community, where they can develop their translation skills, utilise translation resources, share their insights with one another and stay updated on translation-related programmes and events.</li>

	<h3>Promoting best practices</h3>

<p><strong>Whole-of-Government Period Contract and Framework Agreement (WoG PCFA) for Translation Services</strong></p>

<p>Introduced on 7 May 2015, the framework provides a list of translation vendors who have been evaluated for quality and price competitiveness. With this framework, government agencies will be able to procure quality translations at a fair rate with a quicker turn-around time.</p>
	
<p><strong>Government Terms Translated</strong></p>

<p>MCI’s Translation Department maintains the Government Terms Translated repository, which agencies, translation companies and the public can refer to for translations of Government policy-related terms in the four official languages. Click <a href="https://www.translatedterms.gov.sg/">here</a> to visit the repository.</p>
