<h2>Reporting in Singapore</h2>
<h3>Establishing a news bureau</h3>
<p>Media organisations that wish to set up a news bureau in Singapore have
to apply to the Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI) for approval.
To do so, please email MCI’s Media Division <a href="mailto:mci_duty_officer@mci.gov.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">mci_duty_officer@mci.gov.sg</a> with
the following information:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Letter of request from the media organisation, printed on its letterhead</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Background information of the media organisation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CV of correspondent(s)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Please indicate whether the news bureau will be engaging in other activities
besides news gathering and reporting. If the news bureau engages only in
news gathering and reporting, it will be considered a representative office
and does not need to be registered as a business.&nbsp; If the bureau also
engages in other activities, such as the selling of news, then a business
office has to be set up. For this, please contact:</p>
