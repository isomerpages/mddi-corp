## Strengthen Whole-of-Government Crisis Communications Preparedness

During a national crisis, MCI coordinates public communications across the government to effectively manage and respond to the incident. MCI also works with key ministries and agencies on crisis planning to enhance their processes and approaches towards public communications and information management.

## Communicating policies to the public

MCI ensures that policies are communicated clearly, and Singaporeans understand how they will benefit from them. Examples of policies we have communicated include: Pioneer Generation Package, Medishield Life and retirement planning.
