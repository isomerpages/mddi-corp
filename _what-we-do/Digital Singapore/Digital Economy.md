<p>The Digital Economy has generated strong growth for Singapore. It contributed
a value-add of $106 billion or 17% of Singaporeâ€™s GDP in 2022, an increase
from 13% in 2017.</p>
<h3>Equipping Enterprises to seize opportunities in a digital future</h3>
<p>MDDI will continue to support our enterprises in their digitalisation
journey, to transform their business and innovate. Our enterprises have
made good progress in embracing digital technologies. The <a href="https://www.mddi.gov.sg/digital-enterprise-blueprint/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Digital Enterprise Blueprint</a>,
was co-created in consultation with various stakeholders, including SMEs,
industry leaders, solutions providers, and trade associations to power
our enterprises in their next bound of digitalisation. It outlines the
support for SMEs and workers in <strong>four focus areas</strong>, empowering
them to:
<br>
<br><strong>(a) Be smarter in the way they work through harnessing AI; <br>(b) Scale faster through integrated digital solutions; <br>(c) Be safer by enhancing their cyber resilience; and <br>(d) Upskill their workers to fully benefit from the digital solutions.</strong>

<p>To achieve this, we will continue to work with partners and strengthen
collaboration among stakeholders, to empower our enterprises and workers
with the right expertise, resources, networks, and technologies. We will
also work towards building a trusted and digitally resilient ecosystem,
that enables our enterprises to be competitive and expand beyond our borders.</p>
<h3>Empowering Singaporeans through reskilling and upskilling to access good tech jobs</h3>
<p>MDDI will continue to help Singaporeans raise their digital proficiencies,
as well as to access good opportunities in tech. Through TechSkills Accelerator
(TeSA) programmes, we will empower workers, both within the information
and communications sector and across the economy, to upskill and deepen
their proficiencies in high-demand areas such as AI, 5G and cybersecurity.
We will also continue to work with the Ministry of Manpower and Ministry
of Education, as well as industry partners, to ensure that good opportunities
remain accessible to all, through initiatives such as the TechSkills Accelerator
for ITE and Polytechnics Alliance and the Information and Communications
Job Transformation Map.</p>
