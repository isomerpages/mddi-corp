#### Equipping Businesses to seize opportunities in a digital future

MCI will continue to support digital transformation of our businesses and help our Small-Medium Enterprises (SMEs) improve their productivity and access new markets. We will scale adoption of digital utilities that support core business functions, such as e-payment and e-invoicing, and refresh schemes to help firms improve their cybersecurity posture and raise their overall digital maturity. We will also work with partners to shape international rules, benchmarks, and norms, through Digital Economy Agreements and other initiatives.

#### Empowering Singaporeans through reskilling and upskilling to access good tech jobs

MCI will continue to help Singaporeans raise their digital proficiencies, as well as to access good opportunities in tech. Through TechSkills Accelerator (TeSA) programmes, we will empower workers, both within the information and communications sector and across the economy, to upskill and deepen their proficiencies in high-demand areas such as artificial intelligence, 5G and cybersecurity. We will also continue to work with the Ministry of Manpower and Ministry of Education, as well as industry partners, to ensure that good opportunities remain accessible to all, through initiatives such as the TechSkills Accelerator for ITE and Polytechnics Alliance and the Information and Communications Job Transformation Map.
