## Building a safe, secure, resilient and trusted digital environment

The digital future offers unprecedented opportunities for Singapore’s economy and society. In the digital world, we are not constrained by geography or the scale of market size. The borderless nature of the digital domain means that a variety of risks can come from anywhere. These risks can undermine the security and resiliency of our digital ecosystem or the safety of our digital citizens and companies.

The Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI) work with government agencies, industry, and international partners to build a safe, secure, resilient and trusted digital space for our citizens and businesses.

## Digital Defence

Digital Defence is one of the six pillars of Total Defence, to guard against threats from the digital domain.

### Why Digital Defence?  
  
Singapore is an open and connected city-state. As individuals, we are constantly connected through online networks.    
  
New threats from the digital domain can breach data systems and threaten social cohesion. We must evolve our skills and instincts to defend ourselves.  
  
### Be Secure  
  
Individuals and businesses can be secure by practising good cybersecurity habits to safeguard data and devices.

We can be alert by being vigilant against disinformation or fake news that aim to manipulate.

### Be Responsible  
  
We can be responsible by being mindful when producing or sharing content which may impact our community.  
  
Fake news are becoming increasingly sophisticated and pervasive, and they can be difficult to detect. If we think that a piece of information may be untrue, we can play our part in not propagating fake news by not posting or forwarding it.
