<h3>Ensuring our Digital Domain is Safe, Secure, and Resilient</h3>
<p>Digital technologies can offer us unprecedented opportunities to develop
Singaporeâ€™s economy and society. In the digital world, we are not constrained
by geography, or by our market size. However, there are also significant
risks to our digital security, online safety, and social cohesion. The
borderless nature of the digital domain also means that these risks can
come from anywhere.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Digital Development and Information (MDDI) works with
government agencies, industry, and international partners to build a safe,
secure and resilient digital space for our citizens and businesses. This
ensures that the public can have trust and confidence in our digital future.</p>
<h3>Digital Security and Resilience</h3>
<p>MDDI leads the whole-of-government approach to enhance the security and
resilience of the digital domain, to minimise the risk that our digital
space will be disrupted. We work with government agencies and private-sector
partners to mitigate key threats, including cyberattacks, cybercrime, disruption
to digital infrastructure, and misuse of new and emerging technologies
(e.g. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and quantum technologies). This is so
we can trust that digital technologies are safe, secure, and resilient,
as we rely on them for work and play.</p>
<h3>Online Safety</h3>
<p>MDDI also ensures that users are safe as they interact and transact with
each other online. This means that we need to work with agencies and industry
players to minimise the risk of online harms, including fake news, cyberbullying,
and other harmful content. This protects the safety and wellbeing of our
users as they participate in digital society.</p>
<p>We also work with agencies like the Infocomm Media Development Authority
(IMDA) and Government Technology Agency (GovTech) to develop safeguards
to prevent our digital technologies and services from being misused for
crimes like scams.</p>
<h3>Digital Defence</h3>
<p>Amidst rapid digitalisation, it is critical for Singapore and Singaporeans
to be aware of defence in the digital domain. As part of Total Defence,
Digital Defence requires Singaporeans to: (a) practice good cybersecurity
habits; (b) guard against fake news and disinformation; and (c) consider
the impact of our actions on the community.</p>
