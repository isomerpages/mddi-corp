<p>Our vision of a Digital Government is “digital to the core, and serves
with heart”. Digitalisation is an effective means for the Government to
serve citizens with greater empathy, through designing policies and services
that are inclusive, seamless and personalised for all.</p>
<p>The <a href="/files/Publications/dgb_public_document_30dec20.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Digital Government Blueprint (277kb)</a> details
14 key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure our Government’s digitalisation
progress.</p>
<p>New policies and initiatives are continually being added to the Digital
Government Blueprint (DGB) to help us chart the fast-changing tides of
tech and world events. For example, our ongoing drive to enhance our tech
capabilities allowed us to pivot quickly and develop digital tools for
contact tracing and the safe re-opening of Singapore’s economy amid the
COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

</div>
<p>From 2018 to 2020, our push towards deeper and more extensive digitalisation
led to four key changes in the DGB:</p>
<p><strong>1. Going deeper into what “digital to the core” and “serves with a heart” mean</strong>
</p>
<p>There will be greater efforts to use digitalisation to create policies
that are more personalised, and which can be easily adjusted in response
to user behaviour. This will allow the Government to respond to citizens’
needs more effectively. We have already begun this with digital platforms
such as LifeSG.</p>
<p><strong>2. Putting the citizen’s needs first</strong>
</p>
<p>The blueprint’s strategies have been updated to place more emphasis on
users’ needs, to improve how we work, live and play as we harness new technologies
such as AI.</p>
<p><strong>3. Setting targets to meet our near-term future</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>New KPI: At least 70% of eligible Government systems to be on commercial
cloud by 2023</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Update of an existing KPI: Time required to combine and share data for
cross-agency projects to be no more than seven working days</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Setting a future direction in light of COVID-19</strong>
</p>
<p>The pandemic has given renewed impetus for government agencies to digitalise,
including making deeper changes in organisational policy, structure and
culture.</p>
<h3>The progress so far</h3>
<p>Reviewing KPIs regularly allows us to assess our performance and identify
areas for improvement. Here are some statistics as of the end of 2023.</p>
