<p>Our vision of a Digital Government is “digital to the core, and serves
with heart”. Digitalisation is an effective means for the Government to
serve citizens with greater empathy, through designing policies and services
that are inclusive, seamless and personalised for all.</p>
<p>The <a href="/files/Publications/dgb_public_document_30dec20.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Digital Government Blueprint (277kb)</a> outlines
15 key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure our Government’s digitalisation
progress. Some of these KPIs, targeted for completion by 2023, include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>70% of eligible Government systems to be hosted on commercial cloud platforms</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>90-95% of transactions to be completed digitally from end-to-end</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>100% of services to be pre-filled with Government-verified data</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data sharing for cross-agency projects should be completed in no more
than 7 working days</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All public officers to have basic digital literacy skills</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>New policies and initiatives are continually being added to the Digital
Government Blueprint (DGB) to help us chart the fast-changing tides of
tech and world events.</p>

<h3>Cybersecurity and Data Security in the Public Sector</h3>
<p>

the data that is entrusted to it by the public. Secure design principles
are adopted to safeguard Government systems against cybersecurity threats.</p>
<p>We will also ensure that citizens’ data is handled with care, and protect
the data in accordance with the high standards imposed on the public sector
and third-party vendors.</p>
