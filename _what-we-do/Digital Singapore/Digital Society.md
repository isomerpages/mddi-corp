<h2>Building a Safe and Inclusive Digital Society</h2>
<p>The Ministry of Digital Development and Information (MDDI) aims to build
a safe and inclusive society where Singaporeans are empowered and equipped
with skills to harness opportunities and benefit from digital developments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>MDDI works with its agencies, the Infocomm Media Development Authority
(IMDA) and National Library Board (NLB), to oversee and drive programmes
and initiatives to ensure that Singaporeans, especially vulnerable segments,
are equipped with:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_self" href="#get-connected">Digital Access</a>:
internet connectivity and digital devices needed for participation in digital
society&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="#learn-and-explore" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Digital Literacy and Skills</a>,
and have the confidence, and motivation to use technology in their daily
lives.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>MDDI also recognises that a “digital-first", but not "digital-only” approach
is important to ensure that no one is left behind and everyone can participate
in the increasingly digital society, regardless of their digital ability.</p>
<h4>Digital Readiness Blueprint</h4>
<p>The <a href="/files/dr%20blueprint.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Digital Readiness Blueprint</a>,
published in 2018, sets out recommendations for building Digital Readiness
in Singaporeans, guided by four strategic thrusts:</p>
<p>1: Expand and Enhance Digital Access for Inclusivity</p>
<p>2: Infuse Digital Literacy into National Consciousness</p>
<p>3: Empower Community and Businesses to Drive Widespread Adoption of Technology</p>
<p>4: Promote Digital Inclusion by Design</p>
<h4>Singapore Digital Society Report</h4>
<p>The inaugural Singapore Digital Society (SGDS) report was published on
4 November 2023, and assesses the state of Singapore’s digital society
across three dimensions – digital access, digital skills for daily life,
and attitudes towards adopting digital technologies. The report found that
over the past few years, Singapore has made good progress as a digital
society.</p>
<h4>People-Private-Public (3P) Approach to Build a Digitally Inclusive Society</h4>

<img style="height:173px; width:300px;" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/Logos/dfl%20logo.png">
</div>
<p>To galvanise people, private, and public sectors (3P) partnerships and
help Singaporeans enrich their lives by embracing digital as a lifelong
pursuit, the <a href="https://www.digitalforlife.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Digital for Life (DfL) movement</a> was
launched in 2021 as a national movement with the President as its Patron.
Under the movement, the <a href="https://www.imda.gov.sg/digitalforlife/funding#donating-to-our-cause" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">DfL Fund</a> was
also set up to support digital inclusion initiatives by charities and other
community groups. The movement calls for organisations and individuals
to champion projects and activities that promote (1) Digital Technology
and Inclusion and (2) Digital Literacy and Wellness.</p>
