## Building a Safe and Inclusive Digital Society

The Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI) aims to build a safe and inclusive society where Singaporeans are empowered and equipped with skills to harness opportunities and benefit from digital developments.&nbsp;

MCI works with its agencies, the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) and National Library Board (NLB), to oversee and drive programmes and initiatives to ensure that Singaporeans, especially vulnerable segments, are equipped with:&nbsp;

*   [Digital Access](#section1): internet connectivity and digital devices needed for participation in digital society&nbsp;
    
*   [Digital Literacy and Skills](#section2), and have the confidence, and motivation to use technology in their daily lives.&nbsp;

MCI also recognises that a “digital first, but not digital only” approach is important to ensure that no one is left behind and everyone can participate in the increasingly digital society, regardless of their digital ability.

**Digital Readiness Blueprint**

The [Digital Readiness Blueprint](/files/dr%20blueprint.pdf), published in 2018, sets out recommendations for building Digital Readiness in Singaporeans, guided by four strategic thrusts:

1: Expand and Enhance Digital Access for Inclusivity

2: Infuse Digital Literacy into National Consciousness

3: Empower Community and Businesses to Drive Widespread Adoption of Technology

4: Promote Digital Inclusion by Design

**People-Private-Public (3P) Approach to Build a Digitally Inclusive Society**
<img style="height:173px; width:300px;" src="/images/Logos/dfl%20logo.png">
To galvanise people, private, and public sectors (3P) partnerships and help Singaporeans enrich their lives by embracing digital as a lifelong pursuit, the [Digital for Life (DfL) movement](https://www.digitalforlife.gov.sg/) was launched in 2021 as a national movement with the President as its Patron. Under the movement, the [DfL Fund](https://www.imda.gov.sg/digitalforlife/funding#donating-to-our-cause) was also set up to support digital inclusion initiatives by charities and other community groups. The movement calls for organisations and individuals to champion projects and activities that promote (1) Digital Technology and Inclusion and (2) Digital Literacy and Wellness.

**Digital Access Schemes**

Digital access support is provided to vulnerable segments through [Digital Access Schemes](https://eservice.imda.gov.sg/das/homepage) by IMDA.

*   The **DigitalAccess@Home** **scheme** provides subsidised broadband and laptops/tablets to lower-income households to support their lifestyle needs, including work and social activities.
*   The **Mobile Access for Seniors (MAS) scheme** provides subsidised smartphones and mobile data plans for seniors who want to go digital but cannot afford to do so.&nbsp;

**Free Internet Access in Public Spaces**

[Wireless@SG](https://www.imda.gov.sg/how-we-can-help/wireless-at-sg) by IMDA provides free Wi-Fi access in public spaces, in collaboration with venue owners and service providers.&nbsp;

All library members may enjoy free access to NLB eResources and 1 hour of free Internet access daily at the [Multimedia Stations in the libraries](https://www.nlb.gov.sg/main/services/facilities/Multimedia-Stations) (except library@chinatown and library@orchard).&nbsp;

**Technology Opportunities for Persons with Disabilities**

[Tech Able](https://enablingvillage.sg/assistive-technologies-at-the-enabling-village/), an initiative by SG Enable and SPD, is an integrated assistive technology space at the Enabling Village. It features a technology exhibition for persons with disabilities and provides them with assistive device assessment services. Persons with disabilities can find out about devices that will help them in their employment or daily activities.

**Provision of Non-digital Alternatives**  

Government initiatives to equip citizens with digital access and skills are complemented with efforts to support citizens who may still be unwilling and/or unable to transact digitally.&nbsp;

Many Government agencies currently provide in-person and contact centre services, to assist those who may have difficulty transacting online.&nbsp;  

The Public Service has also set up [ServiceSG Centres](https://www.psd.gov.sg/servicesg/) at various heartland locations, to serve as first-stop physical service touchpoints where officers can guide citizens through digital transactions and offer integrated services across different public agencies for citizens.
