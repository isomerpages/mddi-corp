<p>What career development opportunities can I look forward to as a MCI Information
Service scholar / Translation scholar?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Upon graduation, all scholars will join MDDI as an Information Officer.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Information Officers will have the opportunity to work in various capacities
in MDDI and be seconded to Government Ministries and Statutory Boards to
help in communications of policies and programmes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As a young officer, you will generally begin your career in MDDI where
you will receive formal professional and on-the-job training with rotations
to divisions and affiliate attachments; or be seconded to serve in the
corporate communications department in government agencies. Experienced
officers may be seconded to government agencies to assume directorial positions
in the public affairs/ corporate communications departments or serve as
Press Secretaries to Ministers.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For Translation scholars, you will generally begin your career in the
MDDI Translation Department and subsequently be posted to other divisions
or public agencies where your language capabilities could be tapped on
or for exposure to other areas of information work. Experienced Translation
scholars could also be further groomed to assume the role of government
translators / interpreters.</p>
