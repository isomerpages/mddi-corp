**Meet Foong Wai Lumn, Deputy Director, Digital Strategy Office, MCI**

**Hi Wai Lumn! Tell us more about your work as a Deputy Director in the Digital Strategy Office team.**

The Digital Strategy Office paves the way for Singapore’s digital future. We plug ourselves into up-and-coming spaces like Web3, blockchain technology, the Metaverse, etc. With that, we must consider what is required (for Singapore) to thrive in this digital era, and the harms we must safeguard against.

**Can you describe how a typical workday is like for you?**

There is no typical workday in the Digital Strategy Office. We often have many interesting conversations, looking at local and international developments, and distilling what matters to Singapore and Singaporeans.

**What is the most enjoyable/rewarding aspect of your work?**

At MCI, we have the space to be “practical dreamers”. We see the future coming, and we are encouraged to do something about it now. Our organisational culture encourages us to discover, decode, and design for the future; and it is very exciting and fulfilling that we play a key role in this journey for Singapore’s digital future.

**What advice do you have for those who are keen to shape Singapore’s digital future?**

A sense of curiosity is the most important thing, followed by a keen interest in the digital world. Finding answers in an evolving space requires a multitude of perspectives. That is why, we welcome folks from various disciplines and backgrounds to join us, whether you’re from the Public or Private sector.

**Meet Siti Amirah, Manager, Translation Department, MCI**

At the Translation Department (TD), Amirah and her team provides translation services in our four official languages (English, Chinese, Malay and Tamil) for important national initiatives to better inform, connect and engage with our citizens.   

We spoke with Amirah to find out more about her personal #LifeatMCI experience.

**Hi Amirah! Tell us more about your work in the Translation Department.**

TD translates a range of Government communications from Gov.sg WhatsApp messages to ministerial speeches. We also collaborate with community partners and stakeholders including local educational institutions, language and cultural groups, and the Institute for Infocomm Research. This challenges us to go beyond just translation work, but also undertake projects to raise translation and language standards in Singapore.

**Can you describe how a typical workday is like for you?**

A typical workday for me will include working on assignments that require translation and working with colleagues on user testing.

**What is the most enjoyable/rewarding aspect of your work?**

What is rewarding to me is knowing that my work helps to connect and disseminate information to communities that might not be as fluent in English. I also appreciate how my work constantly challenges me to improve my language skills, and keep in touch with linguistic trends.

**Why did you join MCI?**

I joined MCI as part of the Mid-Term MCI Information Service (Translation) Scholarship as I’m deeply interested in languages, and was keen to join the Public Service. The scholarship opportunity felt like a convergence of both my interests. 

**What advice would you give to someone applying for a role in your department?** 

Get ready to be challenged and stay curious! Working in TD goes beyond just translation work as we take on projects too. So, officers need to be ready to be challenged and learn new skills!  

**Are there any misconceptions that people might have about the work that you/your team does? Or any interesting fact about your work at MCI that people might not know about?**

Translation work takes longer than most people expect. However, rendering the most appropriate translation involves some research and understanding of context.

**Meet Darren Wong, Intern at the Futures Unit, MCI**

The cross-divisional Futures Unit anticipates and analyses emerging trends, opportunities, and threats so that MCI is informed and better prepared for the future.

If you are looking for a meaningful internship in the Civil Service, read on to find out what it’s like to intern at MCI.

We spoke with Darren Wong to find out more of his personal #LifeatMCI experience.

**Hi Darren! What made you apply for an internship at MCI?**

Having completed an internship in the Futures Unit at the Prime Minister’s Office, I jumped at the opportunity to intern at MCI to gain new experiences in this new and exciting field.

**What was your internship experience at the MCI Futures Unit like?**

I was involved in two projects during my internship with MCI: one on disinformation, which we are all becoming too familiar with; and the other on identity politics. The latter involved studying the varied viewpoints of different demographics, their info consumption and dissemination habits.

**That sounds like interesting work! What were the key highlights of your internship?**

I was given the opportunity to intern at MCI, even while studying overseas although I flew back to Singapore midway through my internship in January 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. I really enjoyed the opportunities to conduct in-person presentations and appreciated that those I presented to, including Ministers, MCI’s Permanent Secretary and Directors saw value in the work that I was doing.

**What were your biggest takeaways from your internship?**

I learnt the importance of knowing your audience and pitching ideas in a way that is understandable and palatable. As futures work is complex, the information we present may be hard to understand. So, there is a need to frame it in a reader-centric way.

**How would you describe MCI to your peers?**

MCI was a really enjoyable place to work at. My colleagues were very kind to show me around the MCI office and even helped me with preparations prior to my presentations. It was a fun experience. As a Ministry, MCI is future-driven, so everyone is open to new perspectives. It’s a dynamic and positive place to work.

**Any advice for students or fresh graduates interested to intern at MCI?**

I would say go for it! Don’t expect the work to be easy, but don’t be afraid to ask for help when you need it. You won’t be expected to know everything. I was fortunate to have very good mentors during my internship.

**Lastly, tell us something interesting about yourself!**

Firstly, I ran a half marathon while studying at Cambridge University. It was a fantastic experience. Families living along the route in the university town came out of their houses and lined the roads to cheer us on and gave us the much-needed support and motivation to keep going.

Secondly, I hope to be working in the Civil Service after I complete my studies. But first, I’ll be pursuing my Master’s in the super tech-driven state of California!

If you are interested on how technology impacts our lives, read on to find out what it is like to be making sense of this fast-moving area at MCI.  
  
We spoke with Jasmine to find out more about her personal #LifeatMCI experience.  
  
**Hi Jasmine! Which aspects of TO’s work are you most excited about?**

I’m excited that our work covers the latest in tech, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), and guides how they could be developed and adopted across multiple industries. One highlight was setting up a Research, Innovation and Enterprise (RIE) 2025 programme to fund technology solutions to combat online harms.

**Can you share some of your short- and long-term goals for the TO team?**

In the short term, I’m looking forward to building a fuller picture of how digital technology impacts social, economic and geopolitical aspects of our lives. To facilitate this, we engage actively with our statutory boards, tech companies and research partners. All these entities have valuable and unique insights, which are important to support this process.

In the longer term, increased involvement in MCI’s inter-agency projects would be fascinating. I believe that good ideas can be built upon and amplified through collaborative work, such that the sum of its parts can impact how we support a resilient and vibrant digital tech ecosystem, including having more successful local tech companies from Singapore.

**What do you think it takes to succeed in TO?**  
  
I’d say two important traits are focus and interest. Keeping focused on our goals helps us determine what is relevant so that we can stay on track. Secondly, with the tech space constantly evolving, the amount of information to process may seem overwhelming, so having an interest in tech is helpful.  
  
**Before joining MCI, what professional experience did you have to prepare yourself for the work you are currently doing?**

I’ve been keen to immerse myself in tech since my time in Silicon Valley. It was a great experience to have close access and exposure to the movers and shakers in the tech scene then, including start-up founders, venture capitalists, software engineers and best-in-class academics. When I returned to Singapore, I wanted to apply my knowledge and contribute to the local tech scene here. Having worked in areas relating to corporate accelerators, tech start-up investments and talent acquisition, I’m glad to be with MCI, building tech strategies and plans to support upcoming technology investments in Singapore.

**What would you say new hires can look forward to when they join the team?**  
  
You will have a hand in shaping Singapore’s tech strategies!  
  
We’ve all seen, the different viewpoints expressed online around vaccinations during this COVID-19 pandemic, for example. Part of our job is to look to tech to identify malicious intent and  prevent a distortion of reality. Apart from that, our team is made up of smart and motivated individuals. We have senior representatives on our team including our Director, Chief Technical Advisor and Senior Advisor, who come with a wealth of experience and interesting backgrounds. I’ve gained so much knowledge from them.

**Lastly, tell us one little-known fact about you that you wish more people knew.**  
  
In my leisure time, I love listening to podcasts. I prefer podcasts over social media, so that I can actively choose content that interests me.
