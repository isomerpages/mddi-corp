<p>If you are interested on how technology impacts our lives, read on to
find out what it is like to be making sense of this fast-moving area at
MDDI.</p>
<p>We spoke with Jasmine to find out more about her personal #LifeatMDDI
experience.</p>
<p><strong>Hi Jasmine! Which aspects of TO’s work are you most excited about?</strong>
</p>
<p>I’m excited that our work covers the latest in tech, such as Artificial
Intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), and guides how they could
be developed and adopted across multiple industries. One highlight was
setting up a Research, Innovation and Enterprise (RIE) 2025 programme to
fund technology solutions to combat online harms.</p>
<p><strong>Can you share some of your short- and long-term goals for the TO team?</strong>
</p>
<p>In the short term, I’m looking forward to building a fuller picture of
how digital technology impacts social, economic and geopolitical aspects
of our lives. To facilitate this, we engage actively with our statutory
boards, tech companies and research partners. All these entities have valuable
and unique insights, which are important to support this process.</p>
<p>In the longer term, increased involvement in MDDI’s inter-agency projects
would be fascinating. I believe that good ideas can be built upon and amplified
through collaborative work, such that the sum of its parts can impact how
we support a resilient and vibrant digital tech ecosystem, including having
more successful local tech companies from Singapore.</p>

<p><strong>What do you think it takes to succeed in TO?</strong>
</p>
<p>I’d say two important traits are focus and interest. Keeping focused on
our goals helps us determine what is relevant so that we can stay on track.
Secondly, with the tech space constantly evolving, the amount of information
to process may seem overwhelming, so having an interest in tech is helpful.</p>
<p><strong>Before joining MDDI, what professional experience did you have to prepare yourself for the work you are currently doing?</strong>
</p>
<p>I’ve been keen to immerse myself in tech since my time in Silicon Valley.
It was a great experience to have close access and exposure to the movers
and shakers in the tech scene then, including start-up founders, venture
capitalists, software engineers and best-in-class academics. When I returned
to Singapore, I wanted to apply my knowledge and contribute to the local
tech scene here. Having worked in areas relating to corporate accelerators,
tech start-up investments and talent acquisition, I’m glad to be with MDDI,
building tech strategies and plans to support upcoming technology investments
in Singapore.</p>

<p><strong>What would you say new hires can look forward to when they join the team?</strong>
</p>
<p>You will have a hand in shaping Singapore’s tech strategies!</p>
<p>We’ve all seen, the different viewpoints expressed online around vaccinations
during this COVID-19 pandemic, for example. Part of our job is to look
to tech to identify malicious intent and&nbsp; prevent a distortion of
reality. Apart from that, our team is made up of smart and motivated individuals.
We have senior representatives on our team including our Director, Chief
Technical Advisor and Senior Advisor, who come with a wealth of experience
and interesting backgrounds. I’ve gained so much knowledge from them.</p>

<p><strong>Lastly, tell us one little-known fact about you that you wish more people knew.</strong>
</p>
<p>In my leisure time, I love listening to podcasts. I prefer podcasts over
social media, so that I can actively choose content that interests me.</p>

<p><strong>Meet Siti Amirah, Manager, Translation Department, MDDI</strong>
</p>
<p>At the Translation Department (TD), Amirah and her team provides translation
services in our four official languages (English, Chinese, Malay and Tamil)
for important national initiatives to better inform, connect and engage
with our citizens.</p>
<p>We spoke with Amirah to find out more about her personal #LifeatMDDI experience.</p>
<p><strong>Hi Amirah! Tell us more about your work in the Translation Department.</strong>
</p>
<p>TD translates a range of Government communications from Gov.sg WhatsApp
messages to ministerial speeches. We also collaborate with community partners
and stakeholders including local educational institutions, language and
cultural groups, and the Institute for Infocomm Research. This challenges
us to go beyond just translation work, but also undertake projects to raise
translation and language standards in Singapore.</p>

<p><strong>Can you describe how a typical workday is like for you?</strong>
</p>
<p>A typical workday for me will include working on assignments that require
translation and working with colleagues on user testing.</p>
<p><strong>What is the most enjoyable/rewarding aspect of your work?</strong>
</p>
<p>What is rewarding to me is knowing that my work helps to connect and disseminate
information to communities that might not be as fluent in English. I also
appreciate how my work constantly challenges me to improve my language
skills, and keep in touch with linguistic trends.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>Why did you join MDDI?</strong>
</p>
<p>I joined then-MCI as part of the Mid-Term MCI Information Service (Translation)
Scholarship as I’m deeply interested in languages, and was keen to join
the Public Service. The scholarship opportunity felt like a convergence
of both my interests.</p>
<p><strong>What advice would you give to someone applying for a role in your department?</strong>
</p>
<p>Get ready to be challenged and stay curious! Working in TD goes beyond
just translation work as we take on projects too. So, officers need to
be ready to be challenged and learn new skills!</p>
<p><strong>Are there any misconceptions that people might have about the work that you/your team does? Or any interesting fact about your work at MDDI that people might not know about?</strong>
</p>
<p>Translation work takes longer than most people expect. However, rendering
the most appropriate translation involves some research and understanding
of context.</p>

<p><strong>Meet Darren Wong, Intern at the Futures Unit, MCI</strong>
</p>
<p>The cross-divisional Futures Unit anticipates and analyses emerging trends,
opportunities, and threats so that MCI is informed and better prepared
for the future.</p>
<p>Darren is a Geography graduate from Cambridge University, who completed
a 5-month internship with the Futures Unit in MCI.</p>

<p>If you are looking for a meaningful internship in the Civil Service, read
on to find out what it’s like to intern at MCI.</p>
<p>We spoke with Darren Wong to find out more of his personal #LifeatMCI
experience.</p>
<p><strong>Hi Darren! What made you apply for an internship at MCI?</strong>
</p>
<p>Having completed an internship in the Futures Unit at the Prime Minister’s
Office, I jumped at the opportunity to intern at MCI to gain new experiences
in this new and exciting field.</p>
<p><strong>What was your internship experience at the MCI Futures Unit like?</strong>
</p>
<p>I was involved in two projects during my internship with MCI: one on disinformation,
which we are all becoming too familiar with; and the other on identity
politics. The latter involved studying the varied viewpoints of different
demographics, their info consumption and dissemination habits.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/CDD/darren%20wong_photo%202.JPG">
</div>
<p><strong>That sounds like interesting work! What were the key highlights of your internship?</strong>
</p>
<p>I was given the opportunity to intern at MCI, even while studying overseas
although I flew back to Singapore midway through my internship in January
2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. I really enjoyed the opportunities to
conduct in-person presentations and appreciated that those I presented
to, including Ministers, MCI’s Permanent Secretary and Directors saw value
in the work that I was doing.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/CDD/darren%20wong_photo%203.JPG">
</div>
<p><strong>What were your biggest takeaways from your internship?</strong>
</p>
<p>I learnt the importance of knowing your audience and pitching ideas in
a way that is understandable and palatable. As futures work is complex,
the information we present may be hard to understand. So, there is a need
to frame it in a reader-centric way.</p>
<p><strong>How would you describe MCI to your peers?</strong>
</p>
<p>MCI was a really enjoyable place to work at. My colleagues were very kind
to show me around the MCI office and even helped me with preparations prior
to my presentations. It was a fun experience. As a Ministry, MCI is future-driven,
so everyone is open to new perspectives. It’s a dynamic and positive place
to work.</p>
<p><strong>Any advice for students or fresh graduates interested to intern at MCI?</strong>
</p>
<p>I would say go for it! Don’t expect the work to be easy, but don’t be
afraid to ask for help when you need it. You won’t be expected to know
everything. I was fortunate to have very good mentors during my internship.</p>
<p><strong>Lastly, tell us something interesting about yourself!</strong>
</p>
<p>Firstly, I ran a half marathon while studying at Cambridge University.
It was a fantastic experience. Families living along the route in the university
town came out of their houses&nbsp;and lined the roads to cheer us on and
gave us the much-needed support and motivation to keep going.</p>

<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/CDD/darren%20wong_photo%204.jpeg">
</div>
<p>Secondly, I hope to be working in the Civil Service after I complete my
studies. But first, I’ll be pursuing my Master’s in the super tech-driven
state of California!</p>
