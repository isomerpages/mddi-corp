<h4><strong>What is the Translation Talent Development Scheme</strong></h4>
<p>The Translation Talent Development Scheme (TTDS) – an initiative by the
National Translation Committee (NTC) under the Ministry of Digital Development
and Information – supports Singaporean translation and interpretation (T&amp;I)
practitioners from the private sector in deepening their skills.</p>
<p>Awarded recipients can receive up to S$10,000 to upskill. This can be
used to offset 90 per cent of the expenses incurred in their participation
of capability development programme(s) related to translation, interpretation
and/or languages in Singapore and overseas.</p>
<h4><strong>Check your eligibility for TTDS</strong></h4>
<p>You can apply for TTDS if you fulfil all of the following criteria:</p>
