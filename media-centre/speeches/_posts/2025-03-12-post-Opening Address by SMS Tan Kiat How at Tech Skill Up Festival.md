<p>Yean Cheong, Executive Director, SGTech</p>
<p>Francis Lee, Executive Director, Singapore Computer Society</p>
<p>Distinguished guests</p>
<p>Colleagues and friends</p>
<p>A very good morning to all of you.</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>It is wonderful to join all of you here at Singapore’s first Tech Skill-Up
Festival. This Festival is brought to you by the TechSkills Accelerator
(TeSA) for ITE and Polytechnic Alliance, or TIP Alliance for short.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>First, I would like to express my sincere appreciation to IMDA, SGTech
and all the participating companies that have made this Festival possible.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This Festival aims to showcase the benefits of skills-based hiring as
well as the many career and up-skilling pathways available to our ICT students
and graduates.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is an exciting line-up of showcases at the Festival.</p>
<p></p>
<p>a. There are about 100 companies, both from the tech and non-tech sectors,
hiring for more than 1,000 tech positions here at this Festival. They include
companies like Oracle, Temus, and SingTel, looking to hire tech talent
with skills in emerging fields like AI, data science, cybersecurity, and
software development.</p>
<p>b. Industry partners, including hiring companies and training providers
are on hand to provide insights into latest tech trends and the skills
required in today’s workplaces.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is something for everyone:</p>
<p>a. Whether you are a student looking for an internship or apprenticeship
to build your skills and networks before entering the workforce;</p>
<p>b. Or you are looking for a tech-related job opportunity as a fresh graduate
from our Institutes of Higher Learning (IHL);</p>
<p>c. Or you are already in the tech sector and thinking about your next
career move;</p>
<p>d. Or you are a mid-career looking to pivot into a tech role.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I hope that all attendees will benefit from this Festival.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have heard from some ICT graduates and tech professionals that they
are concerned about the employment prospects given recent news of retrenchments
in some companies.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The sector remains poised for growth, and continues to deliver good jobs
for Singaporeans.</p>
<p>a. Singapore’s Digital Economy continues to be significant, accounting
for 17.7% of Singapore’s total GDP in 2023. It represents an annual growth
rate of 11.2% from 2018 to 2023, almost double the overall GDP growth rate
over the same period.</p>
<p>b. We are also seeing substantial investment in transformative technologies
like AI.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Demand for tech roles in Singapore remains healthy.</p>
<p>a. Tech jobs accounted for a rising share of total employment from 4.5%
in 2019 to 5.3% in 2024. These jobs also continue to command good starting
salaries – with tech fresh university graduates earning a median monthly
wage of $5,600, which is about 25% more than the average fresh graduate.</p>
<p>b. The digitalisation of traditionally non-tech industries is picking
up speed, creating demand for tech talent across the entire economy.</p>
<p>c. Companies in these non-tech sectors now contribute around 58% of all
tech roles.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And we are also seeing shifts in tech roles, including new roles that
require new skillsets.</p>
<p>a. The increased adoption of AI has resulted in new roles like AI engineers
and machine learning specialists being highly sought after.</p>
<p>b. Cloud architects and DevOps engineers have become mission-critical
as businesses migrate from on-premise infrastructure to distributed cloud
environments.</p>
<p>c. Meanwhile, cybersecurity has become a strategic imperative, creating
demand for threat intelligence analysts, security operations specialists,
and digital forensics experts.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What all this means is that the demand for tech talent will continue to
grow, and existing tech workers will need to continue to upskill or reskill
to remain relevant.</p>
<p>a. Globally, a 2024 report from management consulting firm Korn Ferry
estimates that by 2030, there will be a global shortage of more than 85
million tech workers.</p>
<p>b. In Singapore, a Randstad survey found that 66% of employers polled
were concerned about the shortage of tech talent with the required skills.</p>
<p>c. In a separate report by “Manpower”, talent in IT and Data were amongst
the most difficult to hire for roles in Singapore.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We are redoubling our efforts to ensure a steady pipeline of tech talent
to meet demand and create opportunities for good jobs for all Singaporeans.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We are building on a strong foundation.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We are at the heart of the fastest growing digital economy in the world.</p>
<p>a. Singapore plays an important role as a gateway to Southeast Asia’s
650 million consumers. Many tech companies like Google, Amazon, and Meta
have their regional HQs here.</p>
<p>b. Our tech talent pipeline remains robust, with Singaporean students
consistently ranking amongst the top in STEM assessments globally.</p>
<p>c. They are also adept at working in multicultural and multidimensional
teams, which put them in good stead to thrive in international environments.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Building from this base, we want to ensure that those with the attitude
and aptitude to work in tech is provided the opportunity to do so. This
is at the heart of our skills-based approach.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How are we achieving this?</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>First, by strengthening our Pre-Employment Training (PET) pipeline through
the promotion of longer internship and apprenticeship programmes, which
are more impactful and allows our students to gain industry relevant skills
early on.</p>
<p>a. I am glad to see more IHLs offering students year-long internships
and more companies taking the effort to develop meaningful experiences
for these interns, such as getting them involved in real-world projects,
mentorships and skills certifications.</p>
<p>b. It is a win-win for all parties when done well – students get to gain
valuable industry experience, companies get to have interns contributing
to real-world projects and schools get to ensure their students are kept
abreast of the latest industry trends.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Second, we are also redoubling our efforts to help mid-career workers
transit into tech roles.</p>
<p>a. Initiatives like IMDA’s Company-Led Training and Work-Study Programmes
enable workers to acquire the relevant skills to work in tech, through
working on actual projects that companies they are attached to are working
on.</p>
<p>b. Till date, these initiatives, and others under the TechSkills Accelerator
(TeSA), have placed more than 19,000 locals into good tech jobs.</p>
<p>c. For emerging tech like AI, we are also providing more company-led training
opportunities for AI practitioners. For example, by expanding the AI Apprenticeship
Programme together with AI Singapore, to meet the growing demand for experts
in AI.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But the Government cannot do this alone. We need companies to change the
way they hire to focus on skills rather than just on academic qualifications.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Government, together with our partners SGTech and the Singapore Computer
Society, has been spearheading this push through the TIP Alliance, where
schools, tech industry associations and leading employers come together
to drive this mindset change.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This has so far yielded positive outcomes.</p>
<p>a. I am pleased to update that since its launch in 2022, over 1,000 good
tech jobs have been committed for ITE and Polytechnic tech graduates. This
includes roles in software engineering, cybersecurity, and also emerging
tech like AI.</p>
<p>b. Over 1,300 students have also completed year-long enhanced internships
and gained industry-relevant skills and on-the-job experience in companies
like Accenture, DBS, Inspire-Tech and OCBC over the last two years. This
year, we have another 700 polytechnic students embarking on year-long enhanced
internships. Till date, over 300 companies have offered these students
such internships.</p>
<p>c. The skills-based hiring movement is also gaining momentum – employers
are increasingly adopting a skills-based hiring approach rather than academic
qualifications.</p>
<p>i. Take for example, Zarine Wong, who graduated from Republic Polytechnic
with a Diploma in Infocomm Security Management in 2021. She was hired by
Ensign Infosecurity, a member of the TIP Alliance, as a Security Operations
Centre Analyst due to her technical expertise.</p>
<p>ii. In recognition of her good performance, she received funding from
the company to attain the Global Information Assurance Certification and
Certified Incident Handler (GCIH) certification. This enabled Zarine to
take up a team lead position within a year, and eventually transited towards
a larger role in threat detection and response.</p>
<p>iii. To further build her skillsets, she is currently working towards
becoming an Offensive Security Certified Professional (OCSP). This is also
funded by Ensign, in line with their commitment to upskill their employees
in the ever-evolving cyber industry.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am glad to share that we have over 200 companies who have pledged to
adopt skills-based hiring for their tech workforce.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And to the students or fresh graduates here, I would like to encourage
you to take advantage of the many opportunities to build up your repertoire
of skills.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One of the FowardSG chapters calls for us to “embrace learning beyond
grades”. There are now numerous pathways to success, and we encourage companies
to view a candidate’s qualities more holistically. It is also incumbent
upon all of you to seize the opportunities. For a start, you can:</p>
<p>a. Start by documenting your skills beyond your academic qualifications,
keeping an account of the projects, CCAs, and part-time work, that demonstrate
valuable skills like teamwork, problem-solving, and communication;</p>
<p>b. Develop a skills-focused resume that highlights capabilities, rather
than just education history; and</p>
<p>c. Pursue certifications and micro-credentials that validate specific
skills that employers value;</p>
<p>d. For the men out there, continue to keep updated on new technical skills
during your time in National Service.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The companies present here have also committed to upskilling and reskilling
their employees for a lifelong career in tech. I would therefore encourage
you to speak to them to see how they are doing so and find out the skills
they are looking for.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Together we can build a more dynamic, inclusive tech industry where opportunity
is determined not by just by paper qualifications but also by skills and
other capabilities that you bring to the table. This is the broader meritocracy
that we envisage under Forward Singapore.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wishing all of you all the best and may you have a productive time at
the Festival.</p>
</li>
</ol>
