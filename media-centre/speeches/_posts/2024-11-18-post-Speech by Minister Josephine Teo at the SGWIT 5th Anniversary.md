<p><strong>Opening Address by Mrs Josephine Teo, Minister for Digital Development and Information, At the SGWIT’s 5th Anniversary (18 November 2024)</strong>
</p>
<p>Dr Ong Chen Hui, Chairperson of SG Women in Tech</p>
<p>Distinguished guests,</p>
<p>Colleagues and friends,</p>
<p>1. I'm always very happy to join SG Women In Tech events because of the
energy and positive vibes that we share as a group of passionate individuals
who care about growing the community of Women in Technology in Singapore.</p>
<p><strong><u>SG Women In Tech has done well but women trying to return to the tech workforce after a break is a challenge</u></strong>
</p>
<p>2. SG Women In Tech was initiated five years ago to:</p>
<p>a. attract and develop more girls and women in tech, because however you
look at it, we are the minority - maybe not a very small minority - but
we are still the minority;</p>
<p>b. raise awareness that diversity and inclusion is great for business.
Increasingly, fewer people need to be told about that, but still, there
will be some; and</p>
<p>c. establish Singapore as a global leader in creating a supportive ecosystem
for Women in Tech.</p>
<p>d. We did not want it to be just lip service. We did not want it to be
just an aspiration. We wanted to be a reality, and that was why we started
SG Women In Tech.</p>
<p>3. Five years on, as a community, SG Women In Tech has done and accomplished
so much to raise awareness and sustain women’s representation in the tech
sector.</p>
<p>4. According to a recent report by BCG and IMDA, the percentage of tech
companies with initiatives to support women has increased from 31% in 2020
to 56% in 2023<sup>1</sup>. How has this been accomplished? Well, partly
by initiatives organised through SG Women In Tech. Some of these programmes
include:</p>
<p>a. Connecting over 115,000 girls in primary, secondary and tertiary schools
with female tech leaders who can serve as their role models, so that within
their own circles, there is someone who is successful in tech that they
can look up to. This programme offers them a chance to have that exposure
that tech is not something that only men do, that women can also be very
successful in technology.</p>
<p>b. Expanding MentorConnect, a cross-company mentorship programme for future
women leaders in tech, making sure that there is a pipeline of women in
the technology field who have more than enough capabilities to occupy top
positions.</p>
<p>c. Engaging companies to pledge for better support systems. We now have
maybe about more than 70 companies, who have signed up for the Corporate
Pledge. I think certainly there is room to expand this further.</p>
<p>d. And not forgetting the “SG 100 Women in Tech” list, where we have recognised
over 300 women and girls for being outstanding role models and their contributions
to the growing tech sector.</p>
<p>5. However, the same report by BCG and IMDA highlighted a significant
challenge -- and that is returning to the workforce after a break can be
daunting, particularly in the fast-evolving tech industry. This is a particularly
acute challenge for women, who often shoulder professional demands and
substantial personal responsibilities at home.</p>
<p>6. Consider the experience of Lidya Salim, whom I had the pleasure of
meeting. She took a two-year break to have her baby, but experienced difficulties
getting back to the workforce despite her impressive background as an APAC
Business Director at a tech-marketing agency. She was beginning to feel
very insecure about herself, when she stood up at an SGWIT event and posed
a question. Whatever question it was, it must have been a great question,
because somehow arising out of that, she got noticed and her network expanded
-- such that she had support not just from her husband and her family,
but also tremendous encouragement from within this network. She then landed
a position as a Corporate Sales Account Manager at Google Cloud. That has
been three years ago. Well done, Lidya!</p>
<p>7. The fact is businesses stand to gain a lot from having more women return
to tech. Such a vast reservoir of skills is lost if we are unable to create
room for the women to return. It is certainly a loss to the individual
who has the capacity to contribute. It is a loss to the companies who could
benefit from these skills, and certainly a loss to our country if we are
unable to harness this wonderful set of skills.</p>
<p>8. There is, of course, another value to bringing women back into the
workforce, particularly if they have started the family. Businesses often
find these women to be exceptional multi-taskers. I myself have been on
the receiving end of such women. Many companies are increasingly realizing
this, and a very good example is Tata Consultancy Services, which shared
that many mothers inevitably develop multitasking skills, as a result of
their role at home. Hence, they are very well-suited for project management
roles. As a result, TCS has decided that they will launch “Rebegin Singapore”
with a commitment to hire 50 returning women in tech.</p>
<p>9. At the International Women’s Day in March this year, I had also asked
the SG Women In Tech team to explore how we can work with our tech ecosystem
to work in systematic support for women professionals re-entering the tech
workforce, so that the likes of TCS and the programmes like Rebegin Singapore
are not just a one-off type of initiative, that they become more of the
norm, and more women and more companies can benefit.</p>
<p><strong><u>Announcement of Relaunch programme</u></strong>
</p>
<p>10. Today, I'm delighted to announce Relaunch – a collaboration with NTUC
LearningHub. This has an aim of empowering women to return confidently
to the tech workforce.</p>
<p>11. Relaunch is a comprehensive approach to support women’s re-entry into
the work force. There are four key pillars of support:</p>
<p>a. Structured Capabilities Building programmes to help women upskill and
stay current with technological advancements via curated tech and soft
skills courses and workshops.</p>
<p>b. Career integration support including community groups or buddy systems
to help returning women renavigate the softer aspects of transition and
process access to resources.</p>
<p>c. Network of support groups and meet-ups to foster a sense of community
and provide opportunities for networking and knowledge sharing.</p>
<p>d. Essential information to reduce the burden of personal and other family
responsibilities such as logistical support of childcare, caregiving subsidies,
eldercare etc.</p>
<p>12. We already have some early success in Relaunch, as more than 20 organisations
have committed to participating, to create more inclusive workplaces and
prepare managers for the returning women.</p>
<p>13. We also kickstarted a mentoring programme in partnership with vLookup.AI
and the Singapore Computer Society. More than 20 mentors are paired with
women returning to work, providing personalised guidance and support tailored
to their unique career goals.</p>
<p>14. I would like to thank the pioneering companies in Relaunch, including
Ant International Foundation, Emerson, LinkedIn and Rakuten for your enthusiastic
support. It is crucial for its success, and we look forward to more organisations
joining in.</p>
<p>15. Looking ahead, we hope to see a tech ecosystem where women are not
just at the backend, but equally at the front, leading and innovating.</p>
<p>16. For this to happen, we need to continue to inspiring girls to pursue
tech and create a self-sustaining ecosystem where women thrive and are
also able to contribute to the mentoring of the next generation.</p>
<p>a. Hence, I’m happy to welcome a group of passionate young girls who are
joining us from the Girls Love Tech event, which is now in its 3rd year.</p>
<p>b. My message to the girls out there: Technology knows no boundaries and
certainly gender should not be a boundary. There is so much that we can
all gain by staying curious and learning from one another. And also with
technology, keep exploring and experimenting!</p>
<p><strong><u>Conclusion</u></strong>
</p>
<p>17. Let me now wrap up my comments by thanking you once again for being
here, by being part of what we consider to be a thriving digital future
for all. When Prime Minister Lawrence Wong launched Smart Nation 2.0 just
a couple of weeks ago, that was what we wanted. We wanted to say that the
digital future should enable all of us, not just some of us, to thrive.
This thriving digital future must certainly include girls, must certainly
include women.</p>
<p>18. Thank you once again for being here and congratulations to SGWIT!</p>
