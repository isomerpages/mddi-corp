<p><strong>Opening Address by Minister Josephine Teo at the Digital Public Good Alliance's Third Annual Members Meeting, 13 November 2024</strong>
</p>
<p>Her Excellency Ms Salima Bah</p>
<p>Ms Liv Marte Nordhaug, Chief Executive Officer of DPGA</p>
<p>Colleagues and Friends</p>
<p><strong><u>Introduction</u></strong>
</p>
<p>1. Good morning, and a very warm welcome to the third Annual Members Meeting
of the DPGA!</p>
<p>2. Thank you for inviting me and for the honour of hosting you in Singapore.
We are very pleased to welcome friends and colleagues from over 40 countries
and organisations, including many of our ASEAN colleagues, as well as colleagues
from the UNDP and GitHub.</p>
<p>3. We appreciate that some of you have travelled very long distances to
be here. You have a full programme lined up, and I’m confident that it
will be as inspiring as it is intensive.</p>
<p><strong><u>Navigating Global Challenges with Technology</u></strong>
</p>
<p>4. Just last month, Singapore refreshed our Smart Nation vision – what
we call Smart Nation 2.0. This comes after a 10-year effort that has seen
significant progress in the development of a vibrant digital economy and
a cohesive digital society, underpinned by a progressive digital government,
as well as comprehensive digital security.</p>
<p>5. In refreshing our vision of a Smart Nation, we have identified three
goals that must now be at the front and centre of all our efforts.</p>
<p>a. The first goal is “growth”, which is about empowering our people and
businesses to use technology to push our own limits and realise our full
potential.</p>
<p>b. The second goal is “community”, which recognises the power of technology,
when used responsibly, to connect people, foster collaboration and strengthen
society.</p>
<p>c. The third goal is “trust”, which addresses the growing concerns about
the reliability of technology, the security and resilience of digital systems
and services, and compromises to our safety and well-being; and whether
there is effective help and recourse if we encounter harms.</p>
<p>6. Singapore is taking active steps towards meeting these goals and I’m
sure my colleagues will be happy to share more with you. But for today’s
purposes, I want to focus on one aspect of Smart Nation 2.0 that deserves
equal attention.</p>
<p>7. An essential part of our refreshed Smart Nation vision is, in fact,
Singapore’s commitment to harness Technology for the Global Good.</p>
<p>a. We firmly believe in the importance of inclusion, so that technology
benefits the many and not just the few. Now, this applies domestically,
as well as internationally.</p>
<p>b. We also believe that the pressing issues of our time – climate change,
ageing populations, widening inequality – these can all be better addressed
with the help of technology.</p>
<p>c. However, to gain from the use of technology, we must be able to manage
their impact.</p>
<p>i. In areas like cybersecurity, combatting online harms and AI governance,
acting alone will not be enough.</p>
<p>ii. They demand coordinated action across countries, and we must invest
to make this happen.</p>
<p>8. Singapore will therefore do our part to build bridges in support of
the Global Digital Compact.</p>
<p>9. In fact, at the recent Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM),
our Prime Minister Mr Lawrence Wong affirmed Singapore’s belief in the
transformative power of artificial intelligence, and our commitment to
support fellow Commonwealth states – especially fellow small states – to
use technologies for the good of our people, economies and the world.</p>
<p>10. In this regard, our commitment compels us to <u>work together with the international community to build consensus around international norms and rules</u>.</p>
<p>a. For instance, we worked closely with ASEAN colleagues – many of whom
are here today – to launch the ASEAN Guide on AI Governance and Ethics
in February this year, and we are working on an Expanded Guide that covers
generative AI. This builds on earlier efforts to develop shared foundations
in cybersecurity and data management.</p>
<p>b. To amplify the voices of smaller states on the global stage, Singapore
also introduced a digital pillar under the Forum of Small States, of which
we are the convenor, from more than 30 years ago. Digital FOSS, as we call
it, is a platform for us to come together to share good practices, as well
as to advance our shared interests.</p>
<p>c. Together with Rwanda, we published the AI Playbook for Small States
in September, so that we can jointly level up our capabilities and participate
meaningfully in international discussions on AI governance. Last week,
we hosted the Digital FOSS Executive Programme, which comes on top of the
Fellowship Programme held in May.</p>
<p>11. <u>We are also committed to deepening our bilateral and multilateral partnerships</u> to
promote trade, foster innovation, and enhance information sharing.</p>
<p>12. We have established multiple Digital Economy Agreements (DEAs), including
the plurilateral Digital Economy Partnership Agreement (DEPA), to facilitate
trusted cross-border data flows, digital trade and innovation as our digital
economies expand.</p>
<p>13. <u>To truly harness technology for the public good for Singapore and the world, we must bridge the global digital divide, through capacity building at the regional and global levels.</u>
</p>
<p>14. We are a contributing member of the International Telecommunications
Union’s Partner2Connect Digital Coalition and have pledged $10 million
Singapore dollars to help the international community harness the potential
of digital technologies in line with the United Nations’ Sustainable Development
Goals. We partner countries like Japan and the US to deliver relevant training
programmes for colleagues in Southeast Asia.</p>
