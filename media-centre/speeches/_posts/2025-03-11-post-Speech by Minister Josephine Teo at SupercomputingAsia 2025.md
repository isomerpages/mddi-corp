<p>Dr Terence Hung, CE, NSCC
<br>Dr Su Yi, Professor Satoshi, Mr John Lim
<br>Your Excellencies
<br>Distinguished guests from all over the world
<br>Colleagues and friends</p>
<p><strong><u>Introduction</u></strong>
</p>
<p>1. Thank you for inviting me to join you at the opening of Supercomputing
Asia 2025.</p>
<p>2. In my capacity as Digital Minister, I’m often asked by international
colleagues: “How does SG think about digital governance?” and “what are
your priorities?”.</p>
<p>3. My response usually has two different aspects.</p>
<p>4. The first is that governance must be in service of some objectives.
For our Smart Nation aspirations, our objectives are to create opportunities
for our people and businesses, to strengthen the sense of trust and safety
in the digital domain, and uphold the values that bind our communities
together, even with the challenges that we will inevitably face when we
go more digital. These objectives guide our strategies and plans.</p>
<p>5. The second part of my answer consists of specific actions that we put
in place to fulfil these objectives. We will always need to ask if our
infrastructure is adequate, and if we are building the right capabilities.
From time to time, we need new legislation or regulations. We have also
learnt over the years that in new and emerging areas, it is useful to foster
partnerships with the private and people sectors, as well as internationally.</p>
<p>6. With this as the backdrop, you may see why I took an interest in SCA
2025. It is very much about making sure we have the right infrastructure
and capabilities to help Singapore and Singaporeans make the best of the
opportunities in the digital age.</p>
<p>7. Since we started on our Smart Nation journey, we have steadily built
up more advanced digital infrastructure and capabilities.</p>
<p>a. In high performance computing, you heard Dr Terence Hung speak about
two supercomputers launched by NSCC last year.</p>
<p>b. It was also in 2024 that we invested a further $270 million to boost
NSCC’s supercomputing capabilities because we believe in it.</p>
<p><strong><u>Building compute resources, developing talent</u></strong>
</p>
<p><em>Building compute resources</em>
</p>
<p>8. We build supercomputers not as badges of honour, but to support our
objectives. In our updated National AI Strategy, for example, we hope to
contribute to AI for the Public Good, for Singapore and the World. One
area that excites us is how AI can be used to address challenges in climate
change.</p>
<p>9. In this regard, NSCC’s supercomputers are already being put to good
use in the Cooling Singapore 2.0 research project. For context, buildings
contribute significantly to greenhouse-gas emissions. Singapore, being
a city state with a lot of high-rise buildings, has both the duty and opportunity
to do something about it.</p>
<p>a. Supercomputers at NSCC have been used to create the Digital Urban Climate
Twin, which integrates vast amounts of data for wind flow, traffic patterns,
and industrial emissions, among other data.</p>
<p>b. Researchers can simulate scenarios to study how Singapore’s climate
will evolve and design better urban cooling solutions in tropical settings.</p>
<p>c. Such research is clearly important to us, but we believe it can also
be useful to our neighbours and friends in other countries.</p>
<p>10. To make the most of this infrastructure, partnerships are useful.
I am therefore pleased that NSCC will add two more to its current networks.</p>
<p>a. With leading chip manufacturer AMD, NSCC will establish a Centre of
Excellence that will give researchers access to AMD’s latest Instinct accelerators
and expertise.</p>
<p>b. With its Finnish counterpart CSC Finland, NSCC will share best practices
and knowledge, to develop HPC capabilities in AI, digital twin technologies,
and green data centres, among other areas.</p>
<p><em>Developing talent</em>
</p>
<p>11. Besides infrastructure, we need to nurture human capabilities.</p>
<p>a. There are many programmes offered by agencies like IMDA and CSA in
partnership with a whole range of companies. I spoke about them last week
in Parliament.</p>
<p>b. I’m also glad that among the many talent development programmes, NSCC
has started the Young Investigator Seed Project, where you partner with
universities here to identify promising young researchers to lead projects.
They will have access to supercomputing resources, build HPC expertise
and apply their minds to solve real-world problems.</p>
<p><strong><u>Broadening businesses’ access to compute resources</u></strong>
</p>
<p>12. Beyond academia, businesses are also keen to access compute resources
for AI and</p>
<p>supercomputing.</p>
<p>a. We are supporting this with up to $150 million for the Enterprise Compute
Initiative for Singapore-based enterprises with the ambition to anchor
AI mandates and grow AI teams here.</p>
<p>b. NSCC has another pilot initiative with DISG to support SMEs and local
start-ups with access to their supercomputers.</p>
<p>13. These initiatives, together with the enthusiasm of the commercial
service providers, help to ensure that compute resources in Singapore fully
support the breadth and depth of enterprise innovations here to make an
impact beyond our shores.</p>
<p><strong><u>Looking ahead: hybrid quantum-classical computing</u></strong>
</p>
<p>14. Still, we must still keep an eye on the future. Part of the challenge
in governing technology development is speed and the cone of uncertainty.
But we can also think of this as an opportunity. In strategic areas, the
ability and willingness to invest for the long term is an advantage.</p>
<p>a. For example, this approach has allowed Singapore to build a strong
base in quantum computing and engage meaningfully with leading players
today.</p>
<p>b. There are also synergies to tap. The National Quantum Computing Hub
draws on NSCC infrastructure, as well as middleware and software development
expertise from the A*STAR Institute of High Performance Computing, and
the NUS Centre for Quantum Technologies.</p>
<p>15. We will take a further step forward today to seed capabilities in
hybrid quantum-classical computing through the new HQCC 1.0 initiative.</p>
<p>a. As experts in this room know, HQCC marries the capabilities of classical
HPC for large-scale data processing with quantum computing’s capacity for
solving highly complex problems.</p>
<p>b. Through this initiative, we aim to:</p>
<p>i. Develop HQCC infrastructure;</p>
<p>ii. Build a critical mass of engineering and scientific talent; and</p>
<p>iii. Foster industry collaborations to apply HQCC in sectors such as computational
biology, finance, and logistics, all of which have the potential to scale
new heights and to become peaks of excellence.</p>
<p><strong><u>Conclusion</u></strong>
</p>
<p>16. I hope I have been able to share Singapore’s approach to leading-edge
technologies such as HPC, quantum, and AI. The initiatives I spoke about—developing
infrastructure, nurturing talent, and building partnerships—are part of
the holistic efforts that draw on the best of the research community and
industry members.</p>
<p>17. We welcome like-minded partners to work with us. I’m also confident
that SCA 2025 will be successful in promoting further collaborations across
sectors and beyond national boundaries.</p>
<p>18. I wish you all a fruitful and inspiring conference.</p>
<p>19. Thank you.</p>
