<p>Mr Mohan Belani, CEO, e27,</p>
<p>Mr Thaddeus Koh, Programs Director and Co-founder, e27,</p>
<p>Distinguished Guests,</p>
<p>Ladies and Gentlemen,</p>
<p></p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am happy to join you for the 10th edition of the Echelon X Technology
and Start-Up Conference organised by e27. This is a significant milestone.
Mohan was sharing with me earlier; we have double the space, double the
presence, double the energy and hopefully double the possibilities and
potential.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the past 10 years, Echelon has engaged numerous stakeholders – from
founders to investors, corporates to governments, facilitating investments,
market expansions and partnerships.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Echelon” has grown to be an important platform for thought leadership
and business matching, developing and bringing together like-minded enterprises
to drive our regional tech ecosystem forward.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The theme of the conference this year is ‘Innovating for a Resilient Future”,
an appropriate topic as I believe we are standing at the cusp of the next
bound of digitalisation.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>Opportunities in the digital economy</u></strong>
</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our digital economy has grown significantly over the last few years.</p>
<p>a. In Singapore, the digital economy grew at a compound annual growth
rate (CAGR) of about 12.9% per annum since 2017, outpacing the overall
economy.</p>
<p>b. We have also generated good job opportunities for Singapore. Today,
we have around 210,000 tech professionals, an increase of 4.7% over the
last 5 years.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This growth is not just in Singapore, but it reflects the overall and
broader growth in Southeast Asia. Southeast Asia’s digital economy is estimated
to have reached US$100 billion in revenue last year, an eight-fold increase
from 2015, based on the 2023 e-Conomy report released by Google, Temasek,
and Bain &amp; Company.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All these point to the fact that there are ample opportunities in Southeast
Asia and in Singapore for companies to capitalise on.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>Role that Singapore can play in supporting the growth of the digital economy in the region</u></strong>
</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And there is no better place to start than Singapore and benefit from
the growth in the region.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Singapore has consistently been ranked one of the best places to conduct
business due to our open markets and practical regulations that encourage
business development.</p>
<p>a. We have always put in place favourable policies towards foreign investment,
foreign trade, and exchange controls, which makes it easy for foreign companies
based in Singapore to support the ecosystem outside Singapore.</p>
<p>b. In 2023, the Economic Intelligence Unit (EIU) assessed that Singapore
was the highest-scoring country in terms of technological readiness, an
indicator of government policies to develop the technology infrastructure
and start-up ecosystem.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Last year, we launched our Digital Connectivity Blueprint to chart our
strategies in the next bound of investments in our digital infrastructure
and services here in Singapore. We have also refreshed our National AI
Strategy, to enable Singapore to benefit from the next bound of AI innovation
that is happening in Singapore and around the world.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>Nurturing the innovation ecosystem in Singapore</u></strong>
</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Beyond these fundamental enablers, we’re investing to nurture an ecosystem
that drives innovation that can make an impact. Let me highlight a few
examples.</p>
<p>a. For enterprises, we aim to provide and facilitate access to digital
resources.</p>
<p>i. For example, we partnered with Google to explore new and exciting use
cases for AI under the Google AI Trailblazers programme. This partnership
resulted in the development of over 100 Gen AI use cases across the public
and private sector.</p>
<p>ii. We will also soon be launching the Digital Enterprise Blueprint later
this month, that focuses on empowering enterprises, especially SMEs, through
the evolving digital landscape.</p>
<p>b. We are also bringing in major investments by tech companies in Singapore
who have also opened the doors for companies to experiment with emerging
tech.</p>
<p>i. At the recent AWS Singapore Summit, AWS announced that it would be
investing an additional S$12 billion to grow its cloud infrastructure and
services in Singapore over the next few years. This includes its new AWS
AI Spring Singapore programme, which aims to accelerate the adoption of
AI in the public and private sector.</p>
<p>ii. We are also working with Microsoft, a significant investor and partner
to Singapore. It recently announced collaborations with agencies such as
SkillsFuture Singapore, NTUC LearningHub and Enterprise Singapore, that
aim to encourage adoption of AI among local businesses and equip the workforce
with relevant AI skills.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We also champion the growth and professional development of our local
tech workforce, to ensure that we have a steady supply of tech talent with
the right skillsets to meet increasing demand. We are investing in our
people so that businesses based here can access the right talent to drive
innovation and businesses.</p>
<p>a. For example, the TechSkills Accelerator programme, or TeSA programme
for short, aims to support individuals that want to either transition into
tech roles, or upskill to remain relevant. We have trained and placed more
than 17,000 locals for tech roles since 2016.</p>
<p>b. Specifically for AI, initiatives such as the AI Apprenticeship Programme
under AI Singapore bring together different universities in Singapore to
develop AI talent through real-world projects. So far, we’ve trained more
than 230 apprentices, with 80% of them receiving job offers before the
end of the programme.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I encourage all of you to take action, whether you are an innovator, an
investor or you are looking out for the latest in the tech scene to adopt
it for your businesses – the future is here, and we want to partner with
all of you to develop the tech ecosystem in Singapore to support the broader
growth of the digital economy in the region and beyond.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is an exciting lineup of events planned throughout the conference.
As you attend the various events, I hope that they will inspire all of
you to continue paving the way forward in innovating together for our region.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you and I wish you all a fruitful conference.</p>
