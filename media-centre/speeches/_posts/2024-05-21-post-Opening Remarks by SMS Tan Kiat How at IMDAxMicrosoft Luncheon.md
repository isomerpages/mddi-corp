<p>Ms Lee Hui Li, MD, Microsoft Singapore</p>
<p></p>
<p>Mr Kiren Kumar, Dy CEO, IMDA</p>
<p></p>
<p>Ladies and Gentlemen</p>
<p></p>
<p>I’m very happy to be here to mark the launch of the AI Pinnacle programme
with Microsoft. Singapore and Microsoft have a very long and deep partnership
that spans many years. At the very start, before there was AI, we explored
how our Word documents and Excel spreadsheets can be used more productively.
I’m very happy to take the partnership to the next level with this programme.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Singapore has been using technology almost from the start. We started
a national computerisation programme very early on when computers were
not that pervasively used. In those days, computers were very different
from computers today. In fact, the phone that you have in your pocket right
now has more computing power, more memory and more resources compared to
the old computers that we used.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Singapore has a small domestic market, and we lack natural resources.
The only thing that Singapore can do to make ourselves relevant is to innovate
by overcoming many of these constraints. Technology is an important enabler
for us to do that. And we've invested heavily in this area. I think we've
seen very good outcomes over the years. In fact, our digital economy today
is growing very well, contributing to about 70% of the GDP and outpacing
the rest of the industry sectors.</p>
<p></p>
<p>And the best opportunities are still ahead of us. You’ve heard of AI,
gen AI, and many other new technologies coming in, and the pace of change,
the pace of innovation will only just accelerate. So, what do we do? Well,
I believe that we must always continue to invest in the future. The best
way to predict the future is to create it and to work hard for it. In Singapore's
case, we invest in our core capabilities, which are our enterprises and
our people.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Our small medium enterprises, as Hui Li mentioned, are the backbone of
our economy. And we've been updating our plans to chart the way forward.
We don't have all the answers, but perfect shouldn't be the enemy of good.
The most important thing is to take that first step and refine our plans,
work with partners, bring innovation to bear, trial and error, and figure
out a way forward.</p>
<p></p>
<p>So last year, we launched our Digital Connectivity Blueprint (DCB) and
refreshed our National AI Strategy (NAIS 2.0). At the end this month, which
is next week, we will launch the Digital Enterprise Blueprint (DEB), which
will take the digitalisation of the economy to the next level. These are
all building blocks to support our ecosystem partners and companies.</p>
<p></p>
<p>So let me just briefly talk about the DEB to give more context to the
partnership with Microsoft today because this support is one part of the
whole vision of the DEB. Under the DEB, there are four focus areas.</p>
<p></p>
<p>First, helping our enterprises to Be Smarter. We aim to use emerging technologies
like AI and genAI to raise our productivity, sharpen your competitiveness,
and to get more market share of new products and services that will enable
us to do so to be smarter.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The second is to Scale Faster. The downside of being an early adopter
in technology is that over time, with many legacy systems in the enterprise
ecosystem, you lose synergies and are often constrained by your digital
infrastructure when trying to scale. So how are we helping our SMEs to
adopt more interoperable solutions, especially for cloud native architectures
working with hyper scalers, like Microsoft and others, to help companies
seize opportunities quickly?</p>
<p></p>
<p>The third area is to Be Safer. Today, stats by the Cybersecurity Agency
show that many of our enterprises, including small enterprises, have encountered
cyber security incidents. Sometimes you may not be a target, but you might
take collateral damage from ransomware, and many cases actually go unreported
by the newspapers. As companies become more digital, it is crucial to prevent
cyber attacks from crippling the whole system.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Lastly, we are looking at creating more jobs and opportunities for our
tech professionals. We have about 210,000 tech professionals across the
board in Singapore, and that’s about 20,000 more than 5 years ago. And
it’s still not enough. Easily today, we have at least 10,000 vacancies.
So how are we supporting our tech professionals to reskill and upskill
so that they can continue to be relevant, especially to be more conversant
in emerging technologies like Cloud, software engineering, AI?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Coming back to the AI partnership with Microsoft, it’s really about working
with technology partners like Microsoft to turbocharge our enterprises
in their AI journey. And how do we do so?</p>
<p></p>
<p>First, for most companies, most SMEs, you don't need to know how to code
and how to deploy code and how to use AI solutions. You just want to use
apps without all the fuss, right? We are working very closely through our
technology providers and many of you here today to empower your digital
solutions with AI so that your existing clients can seamlessly tap on the
capabilities without having to relearn a new set of tools. This is especially
helpful as most companies don't have the luxury of a large IT department.
Under our SMEs Go Digital programme, about 20% of our list of pre-approved
digital solutions are already AI-enabled. We aim to have all of these preapproved
solutions be AI-enabled. Since the launch of SMEs Go Digital programme,
about 90,000 SMEs have already benefited from the this. Over the next two
years, we expect to uplift the capability of more than 15,000 SMEs.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The second is working with partners like Microsoft – enterprises that
are more digital mature. You have different data sources, different digital
solutions, different unique needs, and you might span across different
geographies and markets. Your solutions may require a bit more bespoke
customised support. We will support more mature SMEs like Microsoft to
develop your own solutions. Such companies have greater resources and capabilities
to help to de-risk, to raise the chance of success and to scale quickly.
I encourage companies who are thinking along these lines to tap on the
Gen AI for Digital Leaders Programme and avail yourselves to these resources.
Once these solutions have been developed, IMDA has committed to provide
funding support needed to scale up solutions. And we expect more than 200
companies to benefit from this more mature programme over the next two
years.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I spoke about reskilling and upskilling our tech professionals, which
is something that we are working very hard on. With industry partners like
Microsoft, we aim to upskill and reskill about 18,000 of our tech professionals
in the coming three years in emerging technologies like AI, software engineering,
Cloud and mobility. This is important because our talent is our key resource
to empower the next version of digital economy. So, if your own staff is
keen, please tap on all the resources that government will be putting in
place to support the reskilling and retraining of your tech team. We will
be sharing more of these details at next week’s launch.</p>
<p></p>
<p>All of you here are leaders in your own right, embracing digitalisation
to create your own future, across all industries – even the more traditional
ones such as FnB. Experts are saying that “there is no such thing as sunset
industry, only a sunset mindset”. I commend all of you and welcome all
of you to tap on the various programmes that we're rolling out. You never
know when you will be creating a new solution that will be so impactful
that it will fly our flag high and make waves beyond Singapore. I look
forward to working with all of you to create this future together.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Lastly, MCI will be doing a name change. In Singapore, we don’t do a name
change just for the sake of it – we also want to reflect the emphasis that
we are already putting in place and will continue to focus on in the coming
years. We will soon be known as MDDI, which stands for Ministry of Digital
Development and Information. Hopefully, the next time I meet all of you,
I would have started my project of having an AI-generated co-minister speak
on my behalf.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thank you everyone.</p>
