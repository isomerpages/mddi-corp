<p><strong><u>Introduction</u></strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Mr Speaker, on behalf of the Minister for Communications and Information,
I beg to move that the Bill be now read a second time.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sir, the Cybersecurity Act was enacted in 2018. At that time, we explained
that the Act had three key objectives:</p>
<p>a. First, to strengthen the protection of Singapore’s Critical Information
Infrastructure, or CII, against cyber attacks. Our CII are core computer
systems, that if disrupted, could affect our national security and survival,
and thus were important to secure first;</p>
<p>b. Second, to authorise the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore, or CSA,
to lead in the prevention and response to cybersecurity threats and incidents;
and</p>
<p>c. Third, to establish a licensing framework to regulate cybersecurity
service providers.</p>
<p><strong><u>Lessons Learnt</u></strong>
</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 2018, we saw that there was a need for stronger regulatory levers to
safeguard our national cybersecurity. At that time, we were one of the
first jurisdictions in the world to introduce cybersecurity legislation.
The Cybersecurity Act has now been in force for six years. The core objectives
continue to be relevant today. We have reviewed the Act, learning from
our experiences, and taking into account changes in technology.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We have made progress, and in some certain areas we lead in cybersecurity.
This has allowed us to play a useful role in international efforts to address
cybersecurity challenges. For example, Singapore has been chairing the
United Nations Open-Ended Working Group (or OEWG) on Security of and in
the Use of Information and Communications Technologies since 2021. The
five-year OEWG is the only UN forum for discussions on cybersecurity and
norms for responsible State behaviour in cyberspace. The OEWG is also part
of the reason why Minister Josephine Teo cannot be here today – she is
currently in the US to participate in and lend her support to the OEWG-related
discussions amongst other engagements.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order to continue to ensure Singapore’s cybersecurity, a review and
an update to the Act is needed as several aspects of our operating context
have changed:</p>
<p>a. Technology has evolved, and as a result, business models have changed.</p>
<p>i. Cloud computing as-a-Service has become widely available and widely
used. Approximately 60% of all businesses in Singapore now use some form
of cloud computing technology in their operations. When the Act was first
written, it was the norm for CII to be physical systems held on premise
and entirely owned or controlled by the CII owner. But the advent of cloud
services has challenged this model.</p>
<p>ii. Key benefits of digitalisation are scale and aggregation. Today, it
is possible to aggregate and share common digital services and functions
across borders, to deliver essential services in different countries. This
has likewise challenged us to review how we can safeguard the cybersecurity
of our essential services.</p>
<p>b. The cyber threat landscape has also evolved. Malicious actors are increasingly
finding new ways to their target, such as through supply chain attacks
or starting with adjacent systems. One example Members may be familiar
with is the SolarWinds cybersecurity breach in 2020, where a network management
software that was widely used by major companies worldwide was compromised.
The attacker used the software’s regular updates to implant a backdoor,
gain a foothold in the networks of organisations that downloaded and installed
the malicious update, and then this provided the attacker with privileged
access to internal networks.</p>
<p>c. Our relationship with technology has also evolved. Digital technology
is now an integral part of our lives. In Singapore, over 90% of residents
now communicate online. Firms use digital technologies intensively – their
technology adoption rate has grown from 74% in 2018 to 94% in 2022. More
of us are now online for longer and online for more varied purposes. This
means that we are exposed to more cyber risks, as every digital technology
we use, every transaction we make, and every connection made between computers,
is a possible route for attack. The cybersecurity professionals refer to
this as an increased “attack surface”. To cause significant disruption
to the way we work and live, those who mean us harm can take down the digital
infrastructure we depend on, or the institutions and entities that hold
our sensitive information or perform functions of national interest. Hence,
when it comes to securing Singapore in cyberspace, regulating the cybersecurity
of CIIs is no longer sufficient.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is vital that we update our cybersecurity laws to continue to stay
ahead of the curve.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We are not alone in doing so. Other jurisdictions like Australia, the
European Union, Malaysia, UK, and the US, have also been grappling with
these developments and the ensuing implications on how to do cybersecurity.
These jurisdictions have also recently introduced or announced plans to
have new cybersecurity legislation to address these same concerns.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Additionally, having had the experience of operationalising the Act and
engaging with multiple stakeholders over the last six years, we have received
feedback and we have learnt many lessons on how we can better implement
and enforce the Act.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In developing the Bill before the House today, CSA has consulted extensively
with stakeholders over two years. These included our CII owners, cybersecurity
and legal professionals, academic experts, sector regulators, industry
players, trade associations and chambers, and members of the public. Stakeholders
have generally been supportive of our proposed Bill. They understand the
need for stronger cybersecurity regulation and are supportive of the policy
objectives of the Bill. Our stakeholders have also provided useful feedback
that has helped CSA refine the Bill. I would like to thank all who participated
for their feedback and for their suggestions.</p>
<p><strong>Key Provisions of the Cybersecurity (Amendment) Bill</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Cybersecurity (Amendment) Bill seeks to update the Act to address
the shifts in the operating context in cybersecurity, and strengthen the
administration of the Act to address operational challenges CSA has faced.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mr Speaker, Sir, before I go through the key provisions proposed in the
Bill, allow me explain that I will not disclose in this Opening Speech,
nor in answers to Members' clarifications, any specific real-life examples
of the critical systems and entities that we regulate, or seek to regulate,
for cybersecurity. It is not in Singapore’s national security interests
to do so, as public disclosure of these systems and entities may expose
them to more risks. The list of CIIs is not made public. Similarly, systems
and entities regulated pursuant to the proposed amendments will also not
be made public.</p>
<p><em><u>I. Adapting to the Shifts in Our Operating Context</u></em>
</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sir, the Bill seeks to create new regulatory frameworks to keep up with
the changes in our operating context.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We will update CII-related provisions. The 2018 Act was developed to regulate
CII that were physical systems, but new technology and business models
have emerged since. Hence, we need to update the Act to allow us to better
regulate CIIs so that they continue to be secure and resilient against
cyber threats, whatever technology or business model they run on. The Bill
will do this in the following ways:</p>
<p>a. <u>Clause 3(j)</u> extends the meaning of “computer” and “computer system”
in specified portions of the Act to include “virtual computers” and “virtual
computer systems”, which in turn are defined in new definitions inserted
by clause 3(i). Clause 3(j) also introduces provisions setting out what
“ownership” means in relation to virtual computers or computer systems.</p>
<p>i. Currently, the Act’s definitions of “computer” and “computer system”
are predicated on them being physical computers that are built out of dedicated
physical hardware, such as hard disk drives, memory and processor chips.
This was suitable in 2018, as CII were physical systems. However, given
recent technological advancements, it is now possible that a CII could
be a virtual computer system.</p>
<p>ii. Our interest is in the computer or computer system that is necessary
for the continuous delivery of the essential service, whether it is physical
or virtual. However, in the case of a virtual CII, such as in a Cloud environment,
the underlying physical infrastructure could be shared or easily replaced,
and therefore it would not be sensible or meaningful to regulate the underlying
hardware.</p>
<p>iii. The new definitions we are introducing allow us to make it clear
that the CII owner is responsible for the cybersecurity of its virtualised
CII, and not other parties that supply the underlying physical infrastructure.</p>
<p>b. <u>Clause 14 </u>seeks to introduce a new Part 3A which will regulate
providers of essential services who rely on CII owned by third parties,
for the continuous delivery of essential services. This will deal with
situations where a provider of an essential service could leverage a computer
system owned by a third party, because it could be more effective or efficient
to do so.</p>
<p>i. For example, hypothetically, a third-party vendor could own, operate
and supply a critical Operations Management system that is used by multiple
providers of a given essential service. The third-party vendor could have
greater expertise operating such a system and is able to do so at a lower
cost, due to demand aggregation.</p>
<p>ii. The principal Act did not provide for such business models because
it was the norm then for providers of essential services to own and operate
their critical systems. Business models may be changing, but the fundamental
principle remains the same. Providers of essential services must remain
responsible for the cybersecurity and cyber resilience of the computer
systems relied upon to deliver essential services they provide. New Part
3A will ensure that they cannot outsource this responsibility, even if
they rely on a third party’s computer system for the continuous delivery
of the essential service.</p>
<p>iii. Under the new Part 3A, the responsibility rests with the provider
of essential service. To be clear, CSA does not seek to regulate the owners
of these systems under Part 3A, who are the third-party vendors. However,
the providers of essential services must ensure that the systems they rely
on can meet comparable cybersecurity standards and requirements of a CII
through legally-binding commitments, such as contracts.</p>
<p>iv. Third-party vendors that seek to work with providers of essential
services will need to have the necessary expertise and capability to own
and operate a CII in a manner that meets the cybersecurity standards we
hold a CII to. It is a specialised area and a considered business decision
to operate in this space. Members will appreciate that not many businesses
will be or can be in this space.</p>
<p>c. <u>Clause 8 </u>allows CSA to deal with situations where a CII is supporting
an essential service from overseas. The Act currently only allows CSA to
designate computers or computer systems as CII if the entire or part of
the computer or computer system is in Singapore. However, this has also
meant that CSA is currently unable to regulate a CII that is wholly located
overseas. Clause 8 inserts a new section 7(1A) which will allow CSA to
designate and regulate such CIIs that are wholly located outside Singapore,
so long as its owner is in Singapore and the computer system would have
been designated as a CII under section 7(1) had it been located wholly
or partly in Singapore.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We will also be updating CII-related provisions to address the inventiveness
of malicious cyber actors.</p>
<p>a. Under the principal Act, a CII owner is generally only obliged to report
cybersecurity incidents relating to the CII, or computers or computer systems
that are interconnected with or communicate with the CII. CSA needs such
incident reporting so that it can intervene early if necessary, and gain
a better situational awareness so that it can proactively alert other sectors
and prevent the spread of similar attacks. Such reports serve to sound
the alarm.</p>
<p>b. As the tactics and techniques of malicious actors evolve to target
systems at the periphery or along supply chains, we must also start placing
our alarms at those places. <u>Clause 12 </u>will therefore amend section
14 to require CII owners under Part 3 to additionally report incidents
that affect: (i) other computers under the owner’s control, and (ii) computers
under the control of a supplier that are interconnected with or communicates
with the CII.</p>
<p>i. The former requirement will help us be better prepared should any of
our essential services be targeted in the same manner as in the SolarWinds
case.</p>
<p>ii. The latter requirement will enable us to take proactive steps to protect
our CIIs if CII owners’ immediate suppliers are compromised, to pre- empt
potential disruptions to essential services. The requirement to report
on incidents affecting immediate suppliers will apply only if the CII is
owned by the provider of essential service. This is a practical approach.
In situations where a third party owns the CII, the provider of essential
service is unlikely to have visibility of the third party’s suppliers to
be able to report any incident to CSA.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We will also expand the Act to regulate a new type of system called Systems
of Temporary Cybersecurity Concern, or STCC, so as to address the evolution
of our threat landscape.</p>
<p>a. <u>Clause 15</u> inserts a new Part 3B to regulate the cybersecurity
of STCCs, which are systems that for a time-limited period, are at high
risk of cyber-attacks, and if compromised would have a serious detrimental
effect on Singapore’s national interests.</p>
<p>i. The COVID-19 pandemic drove home the importance of being able to secure
such systems. During the pandemic, many governments around the world developed
temporary systems to support the tracking and distribution of vaccinations,
and many of these systems were targeted by malicious actors seeking to
exploit the urgency of the situation. Should we be faced with another pandemic,
we need to be in the position to secure the systems critical to our crisis
response.</p>
<p>ii. Another potential group of STCCs could include systems supporting
high-key international events in Singapore, such as the Trump-Kim Summit
in 2018, or the Youth Olympic Games in 2010. Such international events
could be attractive targets for cyber-malicious actors seeking a global
stage. The Tokyo Olympics of 2021, for example, was reported to have encountered
450 million cyber attacks. We need to take the cybersecurity of such systems
and such events seriously to maintain Singapore’s reputation as a safe
and reliable place to host such events.</p>
<p>iii. Before the Commissioner of Cybersecurity can designate a system an
STCC, the Commissioner must be satisfied that, for a limited period, the
system is at a high risk of a cybersecurity threat or incident; and the
loss or compromise of the system will have a serious detrimental effect
on the national security, defence, foreign relations, economy, public health,
public safety or public order of Singapore. In other words, this is intended
to apply to systems that are critical to Singapore.</p>
<p>iv. Given that STCCs are critical systems when they are set up, Part 3B
will impose on STCC owners cybersecurity obligations similar to those for
CII owners, where practicable. Part 3B will allow CSA to be proactive in
raising the cybersecurity posture of the STCC, depending on the operating
context and the time period for which the STCC is needed.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, provisions will be introduced to expand the ambit of the Act
to other new entities beyond the current CII regulatory regime.</p>
<p>a. <u>Clause 16</u> introduces a new Part 3C, that will allow CSA to regulate
entities that could be particularly attractive targets for malicious threat
actors, because the disruption of the function they perform, or the disclosure
of sensitive information their computer systems contain, will have a significant
detrimental effect on Singapore’s defence, foreign relations, economy,
public health, public safety, or public order. These entities will be referred
to as “Entities of Special Cybersecurity Interest”, or ESCIs.</p>
<p>i. One example of potential ESCIs could be universities. Universities
are popular targets of malicious actors, given their standing in society,
the sensitive research they may do, and the data they may possess. For
instance, in 2019, the Australian National University detected a database
breach, reportedly by a state actor, which resulted in unauthorised access
to extensive personal information, including bank records, tax details
and passport information of students and staff dating back almost two decades.
Senior Australian officials feared that such data could be used to exploit
or recruit students and alumni as informants.</p>
<p>ii. Our own universities have also been targets of cyber attacks in the
past. MOE and the universities have since taken steps to strengthen their
cybersecurity defences. The proposed amendments in this Bill could further
strengthen our universities’ defences, and enable CSA to take stronger
action to secure them, as well as other entities of special cybersecurity
interest, if they are designated.</p>
<p>iii. However, the specific list of entities designated as ESCIs should
not be disclosed publicly. This is to avoid inadvertently advertising these
entities as worthy targets to malicious actors.</p>
<p>iv. CSA will be able to issue or approve cybersecurity standards of performance
and codes of practice to stipulate the cybersecurity measures ESCIs should
have in place. ESCIs will be required to report prescribed cybersecurity
incidents that result in a breach of the availability, confidentiality,
or integrity of the entities’ data, or have a significant impact on the
business operations of the entities. CSA will also be empowered to issue
written directions to ESCIs, if necessary or expedient, for ensuring the
cybersecurity of the ESCIs or the effective administration of the Act.</p>
<p>v. The obligations we impose on ESCIs will be moderated when compared
to those imposed on CIIs or STCCs, in recognition that the impact on our
national interest resulting from cyber attacks on ESCIs may not be as severe
compared to the impact from cyber attacks on CIIs or STCCs. This ensures
that regulatory obligations are commensurate with the cybersecurity risks
posed.</p>
<p>b. <u>Clause 17</u> introduces a new Part 3D, to cover the last new category
of entities that CSA proposes to regulate for cybersecurity – providers
of “Foundational Digital Infrastructure service”, or FDI service. Our ability
to operate normally, and to enable citizens to meet their day-to-day needs
has become increasingly dependent on the good functioning of the digital
infrastructure that powers our digital economy. The more foundational the
digital infrastructure is to systems central to our work and lives, the
more attractive it is to malicious actors. Infrastructural vulnerabilities
can be exploited to compromise many systems, and can cause widespread disruption.</p>
<p>i. The new Part 3D will allow CSA to regulate major providers of FDI service
for cybersecurity. This refers to entities that serve a large number of
businesses or organisations. This reflects our interest in securing ourselves
against the risk of widespread disruption or deterioration of activities
that rely on or are enabled by the FDI service. This also means that smaller
players, who are more sensitive to regulatory costs, will not be regulated.</p>
<p>ii. These major providers must be providers of FDI services specified
in the new Third Schedule, which will be introduced by Clause 30. The digital
world moves quickly, so our approach must allow for quick adaptation and
agility. For a start, the Third Schedule will cover cloud computing services
and data centre facility services, as they are crucial to the functioning
of a wide array of digital services that enterprises and consumers use
daily. As new types of digital infrastructure grow in importance to our
needs, they can be added to the new Third Schedule.</p>
<p>iii. CSA will be able to issue or approve standards of performance and
codes of practice to stipulate to the major FDI service providers that
have been designated, the expected cybersecurity practices that should
be in place. These providers will also be required to report prescribed
cybersecurity incidents that: (i) result in a disruption or degradation
of the designated provider’s FDI service in Singapore, or (ii) have a significant
impact on the major FDI service provider’s business operations in Singapore.
Recognising that major FDI service providers provide services to clients
across sectors, and often across borders, CSA has been consulting closely
with industry and sector leads to develop inter-operable standards, codes,
and operating parameters. We are mindful about compliance costs for these
major providers and are committed to keeping them reasonable.</p>
<p>iv. The same appeal avenues available to those designated as CII owners
under the Act today will be extended to providers of essential services
under Part 3A, STCC owners, ESCI and major FDI service providers that CSA
designates. For example, any entity that receives a designation notice
may appeal against the designation, and regulated entities can appeal CSA’s
decisions, orders, and directions as well. This is encapsulated in the
new section 35B introduced by <u>Clause 19</u>.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The proposed scope of the Bill is targeted and affects only providers
of essential services, owners of STCCs, ESCI and major FDI providers. These
are a known and finite set, and CSA will be working closely with them.
The Bill does not impose cybersecurity obligations on the larger business
community.</p>
<p><em><u>II. Strengthening the Administration of the Act</u></em>
</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We will also enhance the Act to strengthen the administration of the Act:</p>
<p>a. To improve CSA’s ability to enforce the Act against recalcitrant CII
owners regulated under Part 3 of the Act, <u>Clause 13(b)</u> will amend
section 15(4) to empower CSA to inspect the CII if it appears to the Commissioner
that the CII owner has not complied with its obligations or has provided
information requested under section 10 of the Act that is false, misleading,
inaccurate or incomplete. This is because wilful non-compliance by CII
owners could jeopardise our national security and survival.</p>
<p>b. Currently, Part 5 of the Act regulates persons who provide licensable
cybersecurity services. <u>Clause 18</u> will provide monitoring powers for
licensing officers, for the purposes of executing Part 5. In the absence
of such powers, CSA could face difficulties in seeking information from
uncooperative licensed cybersecurity service providers to verify their
compliance with the conditions of their licences. The new provisions will
give CSA powers of entry and inspection, and to require the production
of records, accounts and documents from licensed cybersecurity service
providers. Non-compliance with such requirements without reasonable excuse
will be a criminal offence.</p>
<p>c. While we seek to strengthen CSA’s ability to act and enforce the law
as the national cybersecurity authority, we recognise that there are criminals
looking to exploit this authority through impersonation scams. <u>Clause 7</u> will
make it an offence for any person to use CSA’s gazetted symbols or representations
without the Commissioner’s prior written permission.</p>
<p>d. <u>Clause 22</u> allows the Commissioner to grant an extension of time
to any person required to do any action under relevant parts of the Act,
as long as there are good reasons to do so. This was borne out of our experience
where there were valid reasons, at times, for regulated entities to not
be able to comply with the obligations of the Act under business-as-usual
timelines. With this amendment, we will be able to grant time extensions
if regulated entities experience extenuating circumstances.</p>
<p><em><u>III. Revised Penalty Regime</u></em>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If these proposed amendments are passed, they will expand the range of
cybersecurity obligations placed on CII owners under the existing Part
3 and regulate four new classes of systems and entities for cybersecurity,
while accounting for the varying degrees of risk posed to Singapore and
Singaporeans. Thus, the Bill also recommends a key revision to the penalties
that can be imposed for non-compliance.</p>
<p>a. In the current Act, non-compliance with statutory obligations in relation
to CII is to be enforced through criminal penalties. This was appropriate
as the measures imposed on CII in the 2018 Act are needed to ensure their
cybersecurity, and in turn the undisrupted delivery of our essential services.
We needed to underscore the gravity if there was any non-compliance.</p>
<p>b. This Bill will introduce more obligations on CII owners under the existing
Part 3, such as the new reporting requirements relating to peripheral systems,
as well as the proposed provisions covering new classes of systems and
entities.</p>
<p>c. With a wider set of proposed obligations, <u>Clause 20</u> gives the
Commissioner the flexibility to bring an action in court for civil penalties
with the Public Prosecutor’s consent. In making a recommendation to the
Public Prosecutor, CSA will consider a range of factors, including the
risks created by the non- compliance, the egregiousness, and the facts
of the case.</p>
<p><strong><u>Conclusion</u></strong>
</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mr Speaker Sir, the Bill is a major update to the Cybersecurity Act given
the significant shifts in the digital domain. The amendments will allow
CSA to:</p>
<p>a. Keep pace with developments in technology and business practices;</p>
<p>b. Respond to evolving cybersecurity challenges in our cyber threat landscape;</p>
<p>c. Extend its regulatory oversight to other important systems and entities
and use a risk-based approach to regulating entities for cybersecurity;
and</p>
<p>d. Administer the Act more effectively.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This Bill will strengthen our national cybersecurity, and increase trust
in using online services in Singapore and in our highly-digitalised nation.
It is calibrated to address the risks to the nation, our economy and our
way of life, while balancing compliance costs. In implementing the proposed
new laws, our experience with the 2018 Act will serve us well, and we will
continue to refine our approach, in consultation with stakeholders and
consider new international best practices as they emerge.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With that, Mr Speaker, I beg to move.</p>
