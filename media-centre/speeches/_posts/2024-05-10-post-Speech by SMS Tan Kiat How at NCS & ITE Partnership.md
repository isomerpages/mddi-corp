<p>Distinguished guests</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Very happy to join all of you here to witness the MOU Signing between
NCS and ITE.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am heartened that industry partners like NCS are taking steps to provide
more developmental and career pathways for our ITE and Polytechnic graduates.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The growth in the digital economy has led to strong demand for tech talent
both globally and locally.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>According to IMDA’s Singapore Digital Economy Report published in October
last year, Singapore’s Digital Economy amounted to S$106 billion in 2022,
equivalent to 17.3% of Singapore’s GDP, which is an increase from 13% in
2017. So, it’s a growing sector contributing to our economy and becoming
a very important engine for Singapore’s growth.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And the expansion of the digital economy is on the back of increasing
adoption of digital technologies by enterprises, which has in turn contributed
to the robust growth of tech manpower.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Singapore, the number of tech professionals has also increased from
around 155,500 in 2017 to 201,100 in 2022 driven by demand across all sectors.
This has translated to good jobs, higher salaries, and better career prospects
for local tech professionals, which account for more than 70% of overall
tech jobs.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tech professionals have enjoyed steady growth in their median wages from
$5,512 in 2017 to $7,376 in 2022.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Similarly, our Information and Digital Technologies (IDT) fresh graduates
have good starting pay, with University IDT graduates taking home the highest
median gross salary at $5,500 in 2023. This is compared to $2,900 for IDT
Polytechnic graduates in 2023 and $1,900 for ICT ITE graduates in 2022.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While the difference in wages for fresh graduates across the Institutes
of Higher Learning (IHL) can reflect varying competencies required for
the job role, there can be greater consideration of skills at the point
of hire as well as throughout the individual’s career.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As 1 in 2 IDT IHL graduates are from ITE and Polytechnics, MCI looked
into this matter with our IHL leadership. We have made three observations
after consulting employers, graduates and then-students at the ITEs and
Polytechnics.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Firstly, companies are overly focused on academic qualifications as the
main, and sometimes only indicator of competency. Many jobs put degree
as a pre-requisite. However, upon closer analysis, not all such jobs require
a degree and there are more suitable ways to assess fit and competence
for the role.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Secondly, employers feedback that graduates may not have sufficient industry-relevant
skills and experience – this is especially important in a fast-moving industry
like tech.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, we discovered that there are insufficient options and structured
pathways for ITE and Polytechnic graduates to develop their careers in
the industry. It is not just about the point of time when you enter the
workforce, but it is what you do in the job throughout your career – reskilling
and upskilling yourself – keeping pace to technological advances and keeping
yourself relevant to the needs of that time.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the spirit of Forward Singapore, we should take a broader and more
inclusive approach recognising that each of us have different talents and
will grow at a different pace. It is more important for employers to recognise
a person’s skills, attitude and willingness to learn over their academic
qualifications.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’m not saying that academic qualifications are not important, but there
are other considerations as well, and employers should consider employees’
potential to grow over time, rather than measure competence at a snapshot
in time. Therefore, employers should empower and support their employees
to upskill themselves throughout their careers, and recognise experience
acquired on the job.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Having made the three observations that I mentioned earlier, the next
question is: so what do we do about it? In Singapore, we take action and
we work together in partnership to make a difference.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We started Tech Skills Accelerator (TESA) for ITE and Polytechnics Alliance,
or TIP Alliance, in 2022 to bring together like-minded partners – school
leadership, tech industry associations and leading employers of tech manpower
to come together to drive change and make an impact.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Together, we launched the Skills-Based Hiring Movement, which includes
a handbook providing practical guidance for firms to attract, assess and
develop tech talent based on competencies. Leading tech employers in the
TIP Alliance have committed 800 good job opportunities for ITE and Polytechnic
graduates.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since then, we have made good progress in encouraging skills-based hiring
in Singapore and creating opportunities for Polytechnic and ITE students
in the tech sector.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NCS is one of 210 employers in Singapore that have signed a pledge in
support of skills-based hiring. Today, I am very heartened that NCS prioritises
skills and practical experience beyond academic qualifications in their
talent attraction and competency development. For example, when hiring
new employees, NCS’ job postings highlight necessary skills over academic
qualifications, and NCS uses technical assessments and project-based evaluations
to assess prospective employees.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For our students, it is also important that we support them in picking
up industry-relevant skills. One avenue to do so is via internships, so
that our students can acquire practical skills through job shadowing or
engaging in industry projects. Thus, as part of the TIP Alliance efforts,
we have worked with Polytechnics and ITEs to extend internship durations
from 6 to 12 months. In 2023, more than 400 Polytechnic and ITE students
undertook year-long internships to gain more industry experience.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a member of the TIP Alliance, NCS’ MOU with ITE is a good example of
how industry and academia can work together to make a difference. Over
the next 3 years, I am very glad that NCS will offer more tech internship
and industry attachment opportunities to ITE students, comprising both
6- and 12-month internships. This means that many more Infocomm and Media
(ICM) ITE students will be able to gain practical industry experience while
studying.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon completion of the internship, students may be offered a full-time
job opportunity with NCS. There, they are encouraged to participate in
NCS’ Ignite work-study programme which hires and trains ITE graduates in
Infrastructure or software development while they are enrolled in a diploma
course from one of Singapore’s ITE colleges or Polytechnics.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Noor Nabilah is a beneficiary of NCS’ Ignite work-study programme. In
2019, Nabilah interned with NCS for 5 months before she was hired by NCS
as an operations support executive. She is currently pursuing a work-study
diploma in Cloud Management and Operations at ITE East. Nabilah is a firm
believer that challenging yourself is the only path that leads to growth.
We will hear more from Nabilah and her peers later today and I hope that
it inspires all our ITE students to seek continuous growth throughout your
careers.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On top of enhanced internships for ITE students, NCS will also be providing
capability development opportunities for ITE staff and work with the ITEs
on knowledge sharing, and curriculum development.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let me conclude by thanking ITE and progressive companies like NCS in
playing an active role in supporting our students in their education and
careers. It is important for students to pick up industry-relevant skills
during your education in school, but also very important for you to get
your hands dirty, understand what it means to work on new project, work
in teams, and what does it mean to lead teams. Opportunities are not just
in Singapore, and digital opportunities are around the world, especially
in our region where Southeast Asia is the fastest growing internet economy
in the world.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For Singapore students, I think we have a unique value proposition – right
skills, right attitude and more importantly, we are trusted to deliver
on what we promise. So the opportunities are bright, especially for all
of you students who are sitting in the audience. I wish you all the best
and let’s seize those opportunities that comes your way. As long as we
continue to upskill and reskill ourselves for development, there will always
be good opportunities, good jobs, good salaries and good career prospects.
So work hard, but always invest in yourself and improve yourself.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>
