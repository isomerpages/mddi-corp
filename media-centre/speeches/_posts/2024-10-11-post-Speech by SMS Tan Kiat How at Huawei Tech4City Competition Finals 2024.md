<p><strong>KEYNOTE SPEECH BY SENIOR MINISTER OF STATE FOR DIGITAL DEVELOPMENT AND INFORMATION TAN KIAT HOW AT HUAWEI’S TECH4CITY COMPETITION FINALS, 11 OCTOBER 2024</strong>
</p>
<p>1. Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p>2. Good afternoon.</p>
<p>3. I would like to thank Huawei Singapore for organising this event. Since
its inception in 2022, this competition has brought together over 1,000
participants and inspired more than 250 ideas. I am happy to see the growing
enthusiasm among our youth in using technology to make meaningful contributions
to our society.</p>
<p>4. We are not just celebrating the achievements of our finalists; we are
also acknowledging the role that our youth play in shaping Singapore’s
digital future.</p>
<p>5. This year’s theme, AI for inclusivity and sustainability, aligns well
with Singapore’s Smart Nation vision, to improve citizens’ lives through
technology. SN2.0 outlines three key goals that serve as a compass to guide
our responses to digital developments. We must be:</p>
<p>a. A Smart Nation that we can trust, one where Singaporeans can go online
with confidence.</p>
<p>b. A Smart Nation that helps all of us grow, one where technology can
help our people learn and excel in better ways.</p>
<p>c. A Smart Nation that brings us together, one that leaves no one behind.</p>
<p>6. One way we are working towards these goals, is by harnessing technology
for urban planning. HDB and A*STAR have developed a modelling tool, the
Integrated Environmental Modeller, that is transforming how we design our
newer estates like Punggol Northshore and Tengah. This tool simulates environmental
factors like wind flow and temperature, allowing us to create more comfortable
and energy efficient homes for Singaporeans. It even helps us identify
ideal spots for solar panels, supporting our sustainability efforts.</p>
<p>7. As we enhance our urban planning, we are also looking at how to better
manage our urban infrastructure. The Punggol Digital District serves as
our pioneering project in this space. In this smart district, we have implemented
digital twins, which are virtual replicas of the physical environment alongside
a network of smart sensors. Through these technologies, we can manage various
urban functions through real-time data and controls at a large scale. They
are also helping us to reduce manpower needs by half and cut energy use
by 30%.</p>
<p>8. From district-wide management to individual buildings and establishments,
the Government and businesses have been deploying smart technologies to
improve efficiency and service delivery. For example, in many of our public
spaces and buildings, you may have noticed robots assisting with various
tasks. Whether it is to address manpower challenges in cleaning services
or for food delivery purposes, they have been used to improve productivity.</p>
<p>9. Beyond digital twins, smart devices and robotics, AI is also making
a significant impact. From enabling the identification of real-time, barrier-free
routes for wheelchair users on SLA’s OneMap platform, to early disease
detection in healthcare. AI is helping us deliver tangible benefits to
our citizens.</p>
<p>10. The ideas from the finalists today contribute to these SN2.0 goals.
For example, Cikgang offers a platform that provides personal learning
experiences to students at scale, while empowering teachers and field experts
to guide and shape the student’s learning journey. BinaCloud employs video
analytics to detect challenges faced by individuals with disabilities and
the public, offering timely alerts and assistance. Node uses AI, AR and
VR to enhance the well-being of elderly residents by fostering community
engagement and preserving personal neighbourhood stories for future generations.
This helps our seniors relive their childhood through familiar tunes like
Chan Mali Chan, Home and oldies they love. This improves the experience
for our seniors through gamification.</p>
<p>11. These are just examples of all the wonderful ideas that all of you
have come up with. I look forward to many new ideas that come out of such
competitions from many young, passionate Singaporeans like you, using technology
for good to improve the lives of fellow citizens.</p>
<p>12. While we continue to build a strong digital foundation for Singapore,
our efforts extend far beyond infrastructure. We are also focusing on digital
technologies that strengthens community bonds to make our city and society
more inclusive and to improve the quality of life for all Singaporeans.</p>
<p>13. At the end of the day, technology is an enabler. What matters is the
kind of value and ethos that form our society and how we care for fellow
Singaporeans. We are using technology to build a more cohesive and inclusive
society for everyone.</p>
<p>14. We must make sure that even as we become more digital, from e-payments
to shopping online, all these digital services that are convenient for
us are also accessible to everyone, including persons with disabilities
and seniors. GovTech’s A11y team created Purple A11y, a tool that enables
development teams to identify and fix accessibility bugs in their websites.
For instance, it can detect unlabelled website components that screen readers
cannot interpret, making navigation difficult for visually impaired users.
Using generative AI, Purple A11y suggests fixes, making websites not only
useable but also meaningful for everyone. As one visually impaired citizen
put it, this tool gives them the dignity to live independently. The A11y
team doesn’t stop there. They also run the A11y Week, an annual event that
promotes the importance of digital inclusion. By raising awareness, we
are ensuring that everyone can fully participate in our increasingly digital
society.</p>
<p>15. So I encourage all of you here, whether you are representing the service
providers, developers, technology providers, or just like-minded passionate
individuals who want to contribute, please join us in this effort to make
our digital society much more inclusive and accessible so that we leave
no one behind.</p>
<p>16. Small things matter. In terms of how we design our website, how we
organise the information on our digital service, we need to put ourselves
in the shoes of those who may find it more challenging.</p>
<p>17. Events like Huawei’s Tech4City competition show us what is possible
when students and professionals come together. These platforms provide
the space for innovation and help shape Singapore’s digital future. One
such example of how these lead to real-world impact, is the collaboration
between the 2022 Tech4City’s winner and SBS Transit. Together, they refined
an AI sign language model and developed the Sign Language Virtual Assistant,
or also known as SiLViA. SiLViA converts MRT announcements to sign language
and answers passengers’ queries in both spoken and sign language to assist
commuters with hearing difficulties. You can try it out at Chinatown MRT
station soon. I commend this effort and want to thank them for making this
step.</p>
<p>18. None of these can happen without collaboration – SN2.0 is a whole-of-nation
effort, involving various sectors and stakeholders. The projects that will
be presented today remind us of the power of bringing together diverse
skills and perspectives, showing us how collaboration leads to meaningful,
impactful solutions.</p>
<p>19. To all the finalists, you are innovators and problem solvers. The
ideas you bring forward today have the potential to address some of the
most pressing challenges our society faces. Do not be afraid to take risks
or embrace failure, as every challenge brings valuable lessons for developing
impactful solutions. If you fail, don’t worry. You are just one step closer
to success.</p>
<p>20. I wish each of you the very best in the competition.</p>
<p>21. And of course, a big thank you to Huawei Singapore for your commitment
to nurturing the next generation of innovators.</p>
<p>22. Thank you.</p>
