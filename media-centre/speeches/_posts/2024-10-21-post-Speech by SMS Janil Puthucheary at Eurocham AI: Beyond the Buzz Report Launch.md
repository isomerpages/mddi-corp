<p><strong>Speech by Dr Janil Puthucheary, Senior Minister of State for Digital Development and Information, at Eurocham’s AI: <em>Beyond the Buzz</em> Report Launch on 21 October 2024</strong>
</p>
<p>Excellencies,</p>
<p>Distinguished guests,</p>
<p>Ladies and Gentlemen,</p>
<p>1. Good morning, and I am very happy join you this morning for the launch
of EuroCham Singapore’s AI: <em>Beyond the Buzz</em> report, which compiles
the knowledge base of AI across Singapore and the EU.</p>
<p>2. Singapore and the EU share a strong economic relationship and have
longstanding cooperation across many domains. We have expanded this cooperation
into the digital domain in recent years. In February last year (2023),
we concluded the <strong>EU-Singapore Digital Partnership (EUSDP) </strong>which
provides an overarching framework for all digital cooperation between the
EU and Singapore. Both sides have agreed to strengthen collaboration in
areas like promoting innovation in AI development, research, and governance.
Building on this, we have concluded negotiations on the EU-Singapore <strong>Digital Trade Agreement (EUSDTA) </strong>earlier
in July (2024). This will enable the open and secure data flows that facilitate
digital trade.</p>
<p>3. I am confident that both the Digital Partnership and Digital Trade
Agreement will enhance business opportunities and create commercially meaningful
outcomes for the many businesses operating across the Singaporean and European
markets. At the same time, this Digital Trade Agreement will also provide
our companies and people the legal certainty and confidence to transact
in the digital economy.</p>
<p>4. Singapore and the EU, as global frontrunners in AI. We also share common
interests on what AI is. We seek to foster AI innovation, while ensuring
its trustworthiness and safety through good governance.</p>
<p>5. As AI continues to advance rapidly, our people and businesses will
need to be adequately equipped with the right capabilities and skills,
to harness the full potential of this transformative technology.</p>
<p>6. Earlier this month, Prime Minister Lawrence Wong launched our refreshed <strong>Smart Nation 2.0</strong> –
we’re not starting from ground zero. This refreshed vision lays out our
vision for Singapore to remain a society where everyone can thrive in the
digital age. Amongst other goals, we reaffirmed our commitment to Growth
in the age of AI. This means advancing the development of AI and fostering
a vibrant AI ecosystem, by empowering our businesses to actively engage
with and benefit from AI for growth of us as individuals and as society,
and deepening this growth – not just AI expansion. For example, we have
partnered with leading technology players to raise AI capabilities of our
small and medium enterprises (SMEs) under the <strong>IMDA’s SMEs Go Digital initiative</strong>.
This is especially useful for SMEs which typically lack the resources and
capabilities, to incorporate ready-to-use and affordable AI tools into
their business processes.</p>
<p>7. Last December, we launched our <strong>National AI Strategy 2.0</strong>.
Again, the most notable thing about it was the “2.0”; we’ve had a previous
National AI Strategy, and we’ve had the opportunity to refresh it in light
of all the developments. And this refreshed National AI underscores our
commitment and ambition for harnessing AI by building our AI ecosystem,
and driving the innovation and adoption of AI applications. Achieving this
involves active industry participation in AI deployment and development,
and I am heartened that we have since made good progress in boosting AI
adoption among companies. For example, EuroCham’s 2024 AI Survey found
that nearly 80% of companies polled are using AI, or are developing AI
applications. Customer Experience, Product Innovation, and business functions
such as sales, enterprise resource planning, HR, and compliance are currently
the most common areas of AI implementation. These are areas where the barriers
are relatively low and the gains are relatively clearer.</p>
<p>8. As we progress in our Smart Nation 2.0 vision, we will need to deploy
AI to solve real-world problems and deliver impact to society. To this
end, companies have established <strong>AI Centres of Excellence</strong> in
Singapore to build up AI capabilities as well as develop AI solutions for
business uses cases that deliver returns on investment. I am encouraged
that EuroCham members have developed compelling use cases in noteworthy
areas like advanced manufacturing, financial services, smart cities, and
education. We have also established the <strong>Sectoral AI Centre of Excellence for Manufacturing (AIMfg)</strong>,
which aims to help accelerate AI adoption in a sector where integrating
AI has been challenging. The gains are there, and we know this is something
that we need to work on.</p>
<p>9. It is not just organisations across sectors that can stand to benefit
immensely from the effective deployment of AI. Workers – not just those
in the technology space – also stand to benefit when they augment their
AI skills and productivity.</p>
<p>10. We have seen many industry partners step up to offer training initiatives
and courses to build up our pool of AI Practitioners and AI Users, since
the launch of our refreshed National AI Strategy 2.0 last year. This includes
60% of EuroCham member companies who have taken the initiative to implement
training programmes to upskill employees in AI, with more planning to do
so in the near future.</p>
<p>11. For companies with few resources to implement such internal training
programmes, or those in non-digitally native sectors, the Government has
introduced various avenues to train, upskill, and reskill our workforce
so that they remain adaptable. For instance, our training partners under
the <strong>Information &amp; Communications Jobs Transformation Map</strong> offer
around 200 AI-related courses for workers looking to upskill themselves.
We worked across industry sectors, not just providing frameworks but directly
providing resources for companies – especially smaller companies – to serve
their workers and our country as a whole. As of December last year, over
1,600 people have been trained to be confident users of AI.</p>
<p>12. I strongly encourage companies to invest with equipping your employees
with AI skill and knowledge to prepare them for an AI-driven world. By
empowering your workforce with the tools to understand and leverage AI,
you not only enhance their ability to thrive in an evolving workplace,
but also position your business to capitalise on the transformative opportunities
that AI brings.</p>
<p>13. Finally, let me briefly touch on Singapore’s approach to AI governance,
and how businesses can tap on available resources or contribute to its
development.</p>
<p>14. We believe AI is a powerful tool that opens doors to new possibilities.
However, we recognise that the proliferation of AI across our economy and
society comes with new risks.</p>
<p>15. To maximise the benefits that AI can bring in a safe and trustworthy
manner, Singapore seeks to address AI’s risks through a principled approach,
practical tools, and industry involvement. And again, we are not starting
from ground zero. We launched our <strong>Model AI Governance Framework</strong> in
2019, which provides a set of principles and practical guidance for developers
and industry to use AI responsibly. And earlier this year, we released
an updated version that addresses the new risks of generative AI. On the
practical front, we also developed <strong>AI Verify</strong> which is a
testing framework and toolkit that allows developers to test and verify
the safety of their AI systems. We extended the AI Verify toolkit from
traditional AI to generative AI with <strong>Project Moonshot</strong> this
year. We also set up the <strong>AI Verify Foundation</strong> to bring together
stakeholders from across industry and the scientific community, to collaborate
and help improve AI Verify. Many companies, including Eurocham members
like SAP and Bosch, have contributed to the framework.</p>
<p>16. All of these efforts, everything that we have done, would not have
been possible without the expertise, support, and partnership of Industry
partners like yourself.</p>
<p>17. As AI continues to evolve, I hope that companies can continue to work
closely with Government to create opportunities, deliver impact, and address
the complex challenges that arise in this space.</p>
<p>18. Please, join us in being at the forefront of AI innovation and deploying
impactful applications across sectors, investing in training initiatives
to upskill your workforce in AI, and contributing to AI safety and governance
efforts in Singapore.</p>
<p>19. Thank you and I look forward to discussing public-private partnership
in detail at the fireside chat later.</p>
