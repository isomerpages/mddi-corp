Lim Teck, Managing Director of Clover Films<br>
Colleagues and friends<br>
<br>
1.<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>I have been very excited about the Premiere ‘Reunion Dinner’ because producer Mr Lim Teck had told me about it more than six months ago, and we had been waiting with great anticipation.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
2.<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>Let me just say briefly why it is significant and why we are excited about it. There are several reasons. This is a “union” of two very significant players. One is, of course, our homegrown showrunner Clover Films, and a very significant international media company iQIYI. And this “union” is brought about by one “matchmaker”, none other than IMDA (Infocomm Media Development Authority). So we're very happy and excited that this product of the “union” has come about.<br>
<br>
3.<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>It is also significant in several other ways. For example, we have long felt that our local talents deserve a bigger international audience and their talents should be shown more widely on an international stage. Through this production, this is one of the ways in which this is being achieved.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
4.<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>Another very important reason why this film is significant is also that stories from Singapore need to be told, and stories from Singapore need to be heard. Our voices should travel far beyond the shores of Singapore. Through this partnership with iQIYI, this is also achievable. So we are very excited and looking forward to the film. We are proud of this production and we hope that it will not only touch your hearts, but it will also touch the hearts of many other viewers from around the world.&nbsp;<br>
