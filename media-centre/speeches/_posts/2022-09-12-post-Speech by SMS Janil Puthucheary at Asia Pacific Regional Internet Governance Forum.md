Ministers,<br>
Excellencies,&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
Distinguished guests,<br>
Ladies and gentlemen,<br>
<br>
1.<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>It is my pleasure to address you all today.<br>
<br>
2.<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>The internet has profoundly transformed societies and economies across the Asia Pacific.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
3.<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>Today, over 2.5 billion individuals in the Asia Pacific use the internet in one form or another.<br>
<br>
4.<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>The internet’s open architecture has dissolved national boundaries and created vast economic opportunities. It has also drastically lowered the costs of collaboration and outreach.<br>
<br>
5.<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>However, the internet also poses unique challenges for governance.<br>
<br>
6.<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>First, the challenge of driving greater inclusion. Amidst the digital revolution, there is a risk that individuals who lack the resources or necessary skills will not be able to reap the benefits of the internet, or that companies who are not at the digital frontier, will be left behind.<br>
<br>
7.<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>The second key issue is that of security and trust. The internet in its nature is open and its anonymity creates opportunities for malicious actors to take advantage of the vulnerable.<br>
<br>
8.<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>This can take the form of misinformation, cyberattacks, or fraudulent schemes, of which crypto scams are merely the latest iteration.<br>
<br>
9.<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>To ensure an open, inclusive, and secure internet, international collaboration is key.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
10.<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>The digital commons cut across state boundaries. If we are to govern it effectively, countries must work together – whether bilaterally, regionally, or at multilateral fora – to set the rules of the road for an increasingly fluid and contested space.<br>
<br>
11.<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>This will allow us to harmonise standards, respond to shared threats, and cooperate on cutting-edge technologies.<br>
<br>
12.<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>For small countries like us in Singapore, we are often price-takers internationally. This approach is key to our digital sovereignty.<br>
<br>
13.<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>Collaboration also allows us to learn from each other’s experiences, whether in fostering inclusion or enhancing cybersecurity.<br>
<br>
14.<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>It is because of the importance of collaboration that platforms like this forum matter so much.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
15.<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>I am sure that the conversations over the next three days will build the partnerships we need to navigate the challenges of governing the internet.<br>
<br>
16.<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>Thank you.<br>
