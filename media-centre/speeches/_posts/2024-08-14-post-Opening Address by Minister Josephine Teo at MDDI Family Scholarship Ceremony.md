<p><strong>OPENING ADDRESS BY MRS JOSEPHINE TEO, MINISTER FOR DIGITAL&nbsp; DEVELOPMENT AND INFORMATION, AT MDDI FAMILY SCHOLARSHIP&nbsp;CEREMONY ON 14 AUG 2024</strong>
</p>
<p>Colleagues and Friends, &nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Introduction </u>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Good afternoon! It’s well past 9 August – but I’d still like to wish
you a happy &nbsp;National Day!&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. There have been many celebrations held all over Singapore to mark our
nation’s 59 years of independence. On these occasions, I meet lots of residents
in Jalan Besar GRC where I serve as MP. &nbsp;</p>
<p>3. When I ask my residents what their work is, some of them whisper “Min
Jo, I’m a civil servant.” They are teachers, Home Team uniformed officers,
GovTech or CSA engineers, librarians, policy and comms officers in agencies
like IMDA and ministries like &nbsp;MDDI… you name it. And my response
is almost always, “Thank you for serving the nation!”&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. I mean this from the bottom of my heart. A very big part of why we
live in a country we can all be proud of is that we have had generations
of good public officers who take &nbsp;their jobs seriously and discharge
their duties faithfully. &nbsp;</p>
<p>5. It is even more so today when school-leavers have very attractive options
in the &nbsp;private sector. Some of our graduands land jobs overseas too,
especially if they completed their education abroad.&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. It is therefore not a given that the public service continues to be
staffed by officers of the right calibre and who are willing to strive
for excellence not just for themselves but &nbsp;for the benefit of other
Singaporeans. This is not to say that there’s anything unpatriotic about
working outside Government, but simply to recognise the special contributions
of public officers to helping Singapore progress. &nbsp;</p>
<p>7. Equally important is the need to develop top talent in areas like AI,
cybersecurity, data analytics, media through the SG Digital Scholarship,
an industry scholarship to boost Singapore’s digital economy. &nbsp;</p>
<p>8. Over the years, many SG Digital scholars have graduated and done well.
They are in demand not just within the tech sector but have also secured
employment in other &nbsp;sectors, such as finance and healthcare. They
now hold leadership positions in MNCs, drive innovation in local companies
or may even have founded enterprising startups. &nbsp;</p>
<p>9. One such example is Carro, an online automotive marketplace and Singapore
unicorn. Unknown to many people, it was started by three SG Digital Scholars
– Mr Aaron Tan, Mr Kelvin Chng and Mr Aditya Lesmana and is today, valued
at more than US$1.5 billion. Backed by Temasek and the Softbank Vision
Fund, Carro is rapidly expanding into &nbsp;Southeast Asia with over four
thousand staff in the region.&nbsp;</p>
<p>10. We will continue to offer scholarships to capable young citizens to
pursue their &nbsp;tertiary education and serve the public. We will also
support our industries with the right talents to help Singapore stay competitive
in the global digital economy. &nbsp;</p>
<p>11. In fact, our Ministry has awarded around 480 scholarships over the
past 5 years. But this year is special because it is the first time that
we are presenting scholarships as &nbsp;the Ministry of Digital Development
and Information – MDDI.&nbsp;</p>
<p>12. As you may know, Prime Minister Lawrence Wong announced the new ministry
MDDI in May this year, along with his first Cabinet line-up. He explained
that the name &nbsp;change – from MCI to MDDI – was a natural extension
of the ministry’s work and a &nbsp;reflection of an important national
priority. &nbsp;</p>
<p>13. After all, digitalisation is a mega trend no one can ignore, and our
ministry has been &nbsp;at the forefront of policymaking and capability
development for Singapore’s digital &nbsp;economy, digital society, digital
government and digital security. &nbsp;</p>
<p>14. Last month, during our first staff conference for the MDDI-family,
I explained why&nbsp; we had settled on being a ministry for “Digital Development”
rather than “Digital&nbsp; Technologies”, “Digital Advancement” or “Digital
Innovation”. This is because we are not just interested in the technologies,
advancements or innovations, but also their impact on&nbsp;people and communities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>15. In addition, we believe we should strive to be a best-in-class developer
of Digital&nbsp; Singapore so that our Smart Nation is one that we can
trust, that helps us grow, and that&nbsp; keep us together. A key part
of this is also how we preserve the infrastructure of fact and&nbsp; uphold
trustworthiness in our info space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>16. We can only fulfil our mission if our talent stays at the forefront
of changes in the digital and information landscape. &nbsp;</p>
<p>17. This means challenging our ourselves to keep abreast of developments
in the digital and information domains, and to design suitable responses
that will help Singaporeans make the most of new opportunities while protecting
all of us from harms. &nbsp;</p>
<p>18. It also means working in partnership with the private, people and
public sectors to complement each other in terms of our capacities and
resources, and be more effective.&nbsp;</p>
<p>19. We have identified 84 promising individuals who we believe can strengthen
the work being done by the already excellent team in the MDDI-family. &nbsp;</p>
<p>20. In addition to these 84 scholars, we also have three PSC Engineering
scholars, who&nbsp;will be joining the MDDI-Family upon their graduation.
They are Eleanor Cheak, who will be&nbsp; joining CSA; Krishnan Adaikkapan
who will be joining GovTech; and Quek Teck Yong, who&nbsp;will be working
at IMDA. Teck Yong is unable to join us today, as he has to see to his
NS&nbsp; commitments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>21. Whether you will be working in the public or private sector when you
graduate, each of you brings something to the table. From mentoring young
techies in your communities to flying Singapore’s flag high at international
events, you have shown the potential to take our Smart Nation forward.
&nbsp;</p>
<p>22. The opportunities you have been given as part of your scholarship
are not just a recognition of your good work, but also an encouragement
to pay it forward. For example, you may want to think about applying your
knowledge and skills to uplift others.&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Fostering a thriving digital future for all</u> &nbsp;</p>
<p>23. 68 of you have been awarded SG Digital Scholarships to pursue undergraduate,
&nbsp;masters, and PhD courses in top universities. &nbsp;</p>
<p>a. One recipient, Yao Yiheng, is pushing boundaries through his cutting-edge
&nbsp;interdisciplinary research in machine learning. His scholarship is
part of our multi year National AI Strategy to build a thriving AI ecosystem
in Singapore. Yiheng is &nbsp;also passionate about giving back and does
so by mentoring undergraduates. &nbsp;</p>
<p>24. Several of our Smart Nation scholarship recipients, have already demonstrated
remarkable dedication to using technology for the betterment of their communities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>a. Euan Lim and Varshan Balakrishnan have helped those around them enhance
their tech skills. Upon completing their studies and joining GovTech, they
will continue to &nbsp;translate their learning into tangible products
and policies that benefit &nbsp;Singaporeans.&nbsp;</p>
<p>b. Huang Wei'En built a Telegram bot to streamline the venue booking process
at his &nbsp;university. He will join IMDA after his studies, bringing
his innovative approach to &nbsp;uplift our digital society and ensure
that every individual is given the opportunity to&nbsp;thrive in the digital
age. &nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Engaging hearts and minds</u> &nbsp;</p>
<p>25. Our NLB scholarship recipients will support our efforts to reimagine
the future of libraries and archives in a digitalised world. &nbsp;</p>
<p>a. For instance, Ho Li Xuan wants to see how technology can enhance citizens’
&nbsp;experiences of libraries. I eagerly await seeing her ideas turn into
reality! &nbsp;</p>
<p>26. In an age of social media and fake news, how we communicate and engage
Singaporeans’ hearts and minds is crucial too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>a. Our Information Scholarship recipients, like Joi Chan, are well-equipped
to navigate &nbsp;evolving communication trends and effectively engage
with diverse groups. Joi's &nbsp;active volunteerism with ex-offenders
and children demonstrates her empathy - a crucial skill for effective communication,
across different segments of society.</p>
<p><u>Conclusion</u>&nbsp;</p>
<p>27. There are many more scholarship recipients that I did not name but
whose stories &nbsp;are no less inspiring. They give me hope that we can
together shape a thriving digital future &nbsp;for all Singaporeans.&nbsp;</p>
<p>28. It is also with this thought in mind that we have considered what
the new logo for MDDI should project. &nbsp;</p>
<p>29. Before I present it to you, let me just say that it embodies the Ministry’s
dynamic work leading Singapore's digital development. Inspired by the iconic
Old Hill Street Police Station, the vibrant colours reflect our commitment
to effective communication, embracing technology, and a forward-looking
vision for Singapore. &nbsp;</p>
<p>30. As we plan for the future, we are also investing in our next generation
of leaders who will be integral to shaping our digital landscape.&nbsp;</p>
<p>31. All of you have tremendous potential, and I invite you to advance
the mission of &nbsp;MDDI, to better serve the needs of Singaporeans in
the digital age.&nbsp;</p>
<p>32. Once again, my heartiest congratulations to each and every one of
our scholars. I want to also say a big thank you to the parents for allowing
your children to build their &nbsp;careers in the MDDI-Family, and to contribute
to Singapore in their own unique and special ways. &nbsp;</p>
<p>33. Thank you.</p>
