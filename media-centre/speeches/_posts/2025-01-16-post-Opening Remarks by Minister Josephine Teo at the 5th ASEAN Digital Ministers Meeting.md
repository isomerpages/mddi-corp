<p><strong>Opening Remarks by Minister Josephine Teo at the 5th ASEAN Digital Ministers Meeting on 16 January 2025</strong>
</p>
<p>Your Excellency Mr. Prasert Jantararuangtong, Deputy Prime Minister and
Minister of Digital Economy and Society of the Kingdom of Thailand</p>
<p>Fellow Digital Ministers</p>
<p>Excellencies</p>
<p>Distinguished guests</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen</p>
<p><strong><u>Introduction</u></strong>
</p>
<p>1. First of all, I would like to thank Deputy Prime Minister Prasert and
the Royal Thai Government for the warm hospitality and hosting the 5th
ADGMIN.</p>
<p>2. Colleagues, we are now a community of like-minded partners and friends.
I think it is no exaggeration to say that ASEAN has made remarkable progress
on our digital journey, underpinned by our collective commitment to build
an inclusive and trusted digital ecosystem.</p>
<p><strong><u>Working Groups Established in 2024</u></strong>
</p>
<p>3. Over the past year, we have established and convened three new working
groups to address key issues:</p>
<p>4. First, under the leadership of Thailand, we convened the ASEAN Working
Group on Anti-Online Scams (WG-AS) to collaboratively combat scams across
digital and telecommunications channels. This Working Group facilitates
the sharing of policies, best practices and strategic intelligence. It
will play a crucial role in our collective efforts to counter this transboundary
issue.</p>
<p>5. Second, we have convened the ASEAN Working Group on AI Governance (WG-AI)
to oversee AI governance initiatives within ASEAN. The Working Group has
facilitated useful discussions on this important topic and undertaken several
projects, including the expansion of the ASEAN Guide on AI Governance to
address Generative AI. This makes us one of the few multinational groupings
that have taken on such a challenge.</p>
<p>6. We recognise that AI is a significant topic that impacts all our countries
and citizens. It also cuts across the different ASEAN Sectoral Bodies.
We therefore welcome Secretary-General Dr. Kao’s suggestion for the ADGMIN
and ADGSOM to lead ASEAN’s AI initiatives, and to coordinate and advise
on AI matters across all other ASEAN Sectoral Bodies. I am confident that
our Working Group on AI will continue its vital work, supporting the ASEAN
Digital Ministers in these expanded roles.</p>
<p>7. Third, we have convened the ASEAN Working Group on Submarine Cables
(WG-SC). Submarine cables are critical undersea infrastructure that are
susceptible to damage. Annually, there are between 150 to 200 submarine
cable incidents worldwide, with over 50 cable cuts in the Asia Pacific
and Indian Ocean. The most common causes are the trawling of nets and dredges,
improperly stowed anchors and anchoring outside of approved anchorages.</p>
<p>8. Damage to submarine cables can disrupt digital connectivity in ASEAN
and globally. For instance, some South Asian countries experienced Internet
service disruptions when a submarine cable in the Straits of Malacca was
damaged in April last year. The increasing digitalisation of our economies
and societies underscores the need for better coordination to enhance cable
resilience. Governments and the cable industry are strengthening education
and adopting international best practices for submarine cable protection
and repairs.</p>
<p>9. I am encouraged that ASEAN is aligned with these positive initiatives
and recognises the need for robust standards to address this issue. I am
happy to note that the WG-SC has started its discussions on updating the
2019 ASEAN Guidelines to include best practices to fortify ASEAN’s submarine
cable network.</p>
<p>10. Apart from the three new working groups, we have also continued to
build on our cooperation in other key areas. One important area is the
facilitation of cross-border data flows, undertaken by the Working Group
on Digital Data Governance (WG-DDG).</p>
<p>11. The Working Group has developed an Operational Framework for Global
Cross-Border Privacy Rules (CBPR) and Global Privacy Recognition for Processors,
to provide step-by-step guidance on how ASEAN Member States can participate
in the Global CBPR. Alongside the ASEAN Model Contractual Clauses, the
Global CBPR will facilitate a more seamless data flow, which can in turn
inject greater vibrancy into our digital economies while ensuring the necessary
data protection.</p>
<p>12. The Working Group has also completed the mapping of ASEAN Model Contractual
Clauses (MCCs) and Ibero-American Data Protection Network MCCs. This practical
guide helps to create a common understanding between both regions, facilitating
contractual negotiations for cross border data transfers.</p>
<p><strong><u>Cybersecurity</u></strong>
</p>
<p>13. Let me turn now to cybersecurity. We have made significant strides
in cybersecurity cooperation, evidenced by the successful convening of
the first ASEAN Regional CERT Taskforce. This meeting was held in Singapore
last August, under the able coordination of Malaysia. We also celebrated
the launch of the ASEAN Regional CERT's physical facility during the 9th
ASEAN Ministerial Conference on Cybersecurity last October.</p>
<p>14. Our next step is to operationalise the ASEAN Regional CERT. This pivotal
step will enhance CERT-related information sharing and capacity building
among ASEAN Member States, fostering a more rapid and collaborative response
to cyber threats.</p>
<p>15. Another milestone was the completion of the ASEAN Checklist for the
Implementation of the Norms of Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace,
with contributions from all ASEAN Member States and in partnership with
the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research. The Checklist was
endorsed at the 5th ASEAN Cybersecurity Coordinating Committee Meeting,
and positions ASEAN as the first region to devise such a framework. As
a voluntary reference, it will assist ASEAN Member States in taking concrete
actions to build capacity and align the implementation of these norms with
our national priorities and capabilities.</p>
<p><strong><u>Conclusion</u></strong>
</p>
<p>16. Collectively, all of our efforts will contribute towards a secure,
innovative and inclusive digital ecosystem, which underpins our growing
ASEAN digital economy.</p>
<p>17. As the outgoing Chair, I would like to express my appreciation to
my fellow ASEAN Ministers for your support during Singapore’s ADGMIN Chairmanship
in 2024. I would also like to thank all our Senior Officials for their
hard work and dedication in implementing the 2024 workplan and activities.</p>
<p>18. Singapore is pleased to hand over the ADGMIN Chairmanship to Thailand.
We look forward to Deputy Prime Minister Prasert’s leadership as we work
together to harness digital technologies for the benefit of our countries
and peoples, for a brighter future for all of us in ASEAN. Thank you very
much.</p>
