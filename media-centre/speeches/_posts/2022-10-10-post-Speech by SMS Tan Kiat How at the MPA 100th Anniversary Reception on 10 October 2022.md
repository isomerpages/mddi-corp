<p>Mr Charles Rivkin&nbsp;<br>
Chairman and CEO of the Motion Picture Association,<br>
Ambassador Jonathan Kaplan,<br>
Distinguished Guests,<br>
Ladies and Gentlemen</p>
<p>
1.<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>Tonight’s reception marks both the 100th Anniversary of the Motion Picture Association (MPA), as well as the MPA’s 40th Anniversary in Singapore, where your Asia-Pacific team is based. My heartiest congratulations to the staff and management team of MPA on this important milestone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>Over the past century, the MPA has been integral to the development of the motion picture industry worldwide, not only through the innovation and creativity of your member studios, comprising many household names of film and TV entertainment, but also through the Association’s effort in safeguarding and advancing the interests of creatives and audiences.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>MPA’s long presence in Singapore testifies to our warm relationship. For example, we welcomed the opening of WarnerMedia’s Regional Headquarters in Singapore last year. They join Disney, Netflix, and many others, which have made Singapore their home in the region. We welcome these international media firms to Singapore, which add vibrancy to our ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4.<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>We believe that this is a win-win partnership. Our media ecosystem adds value to firms and studios based here. At the same time, they create exciting opportunities to showcase our local players and media talent on the world stage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>5.<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>The MPA’s four focus areas – preserving creativity, driving economic growth, fostering technological innovation, and promoting inclusion, diversity and outreach are aligned with the Government’s vision and ambition in developing the media industry here in Singapore.&nbsp;</p>
<p>6.<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>Over the years, we have enhanced protections for creators, such as through the Copyright Act 2021, which strengthens remuneration rights and deters piracy. Our IP regime now ranks consistently among the world’s best , and we will continue to work closely with industry partners to safeguard innovation and creativity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>7.<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>The Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) also equips a diverse pool of talents with the skills they will need to thrive in this dynamic sector, through targeted initiatives like the Online Creators’ Programme and Media Talent Progression Programme. Both initiatives seek to provide valuable training and exposure through partnerships with leading industry players, or other collaborations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>8.<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>One example is the film Ajoomma, a groundbreaking co-production between Singapore and South Korea which was supported by IMDA’s New Director grant. The film has just been announced last week as Singapore’s entry to the Oscars in 2023. Such efforts have led to many fruitful collaborations with your member studios.&nbsp;</p>
<p>9.<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>Earlier this year, for instance, we worked with Netflix on a Series Writing Workshop for emerging screenwriters from Singapore and the region, giving them the opportunity to hone their craft and broaden their portfolio and credentials.&nbsp; Likewise, under our enhanced Capability Partnership Programme, as many as 80 Singapore media SMEs will also benefit from partnerships with global studios to co-create quality content.&nbsp;</p>
<p>10.<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>Such collaborations will not only uncover new talent and growth opportunities, but also help to bring the region’s rich tapestry of stories and cultures to audiences around the world. I look forward to continuing our partnership, as we seize new opportunities in the evolving media landscape.&nbsp;</p>
<p>11.<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>Congratulations once again; and have a wonderful evening ahead.&nbsp;</p>
