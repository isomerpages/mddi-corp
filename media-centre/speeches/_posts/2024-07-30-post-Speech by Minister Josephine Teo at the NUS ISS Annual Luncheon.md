<p>Ms Janet Ang, Chairman, NUS-ISS</p>
<p>Professor Bernard Tan, NUS</p>
<p>Mr Khoong Chan Meng, CEO, NUS-ISS,</p>
<p>Distinguished Colleagues and Friends</p>
<p>Good afternoon.</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>A few months ago, whilst Janet was still in Parliament, she had approached
me to talk about your annual luncheon. All of us know that Janet is a very
hard person to say no to. So, when I was thinking about what to say in
this speech, one part that struck me was what you had articulated as your
strategy in your review for ISS 2030, and it was mentioned that you have
decided to focus on executive education, graduate programmes, international
industry engagements, as well as organisational development.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As I have my colleagues from the MDDI family with me today, including
the Chief Executive Officers of IMDA and GovTech, I thought it befitting
for me to share briefly on how as ISS is seeking to accelerate digital
excellence, in Government too, we think about how we can achieve excellence
in digital development. This includes how the Government can be a best-in-class
developer of a Smart Nation; how we implement digital governance beyond
just laws and regulations; and what we do to help strengthen the role that
we play in AI.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now, this is the 10th anniversary of the Smart Nation initiative. So,
in the not-too-distant future, we will launch the upgrade: Smart Nation
2.0. The substance will be revealed during the launch, but I do want to
say a little bit about digital governance because it will relate to what
I want to spend a bit of time talking about, which is AI.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are perhaps five pillars that we try to do in terms of achieving
excellence in digital governance. We start off as with most things with:</p>
<p></p>
<p>a. Infrastructure. You have got to be able to develop the infrastructure.
If you want to have excellence in connectivity, but you do not have the
cables that connect us up - if you don't have the digital infrastructure
- there's nothing to talk about.</p>
<p></p>
<p>b. The other thing that we tried to do in terms of achieving excellence
in digital governance is capability development of the workforce. We have
to think about capability development within the enterprises, within our
research community, and in fact, to build up our ability to govern. Governing
the digital domain is not something that you can easily study the experiences
elsewhere and then say just adapt to the Singapore circumstances, as very
few countries have it figured out. So, in that regard, we have to be the
ones to invest in building up the government capabilities. Part of it involves
getting our hands dirty, knowing how the technology works, being able to
operationalise projects, and also be in the day-to-day running digital
information that we want to see happen in the private sector and in other
organisations.</p>
<p></p>
<p>c. On laws and regulations. We try not to be behind the curve, and we
try to always ask what's over the horizon. There is always a very careful
balance we must strike. There is a risk of overdoing it. So, in terms of
laws and regulations - how we manage risks, how we put in place guidelines
- is another very important feature.</p>
<p></p>
<p>d. We also do not imagine that the government can do it on our own. While
the government can do a great number of things, it is better if we are
able to bring partners into the picture. For example, in terms of digital
inclusion, it would be much better to be brought into the picture by a
social service agency to tell us what the people’s needs are and to match
their needs. A whole-of-nation approach is probably going to work better
for us, and that's what we have been doing.</p>
<p></p>
<p>e. Another aspect of this partnership mindset will also extend to how
we engage with our international colleagues. Whether it is in cybersecurity,
seeking cross border data flows or developing AI CPUs, we cannot seek to
do it alone, because of the global nature of the innovations as well as
their consequences. We cannot imagine trying to build and set the standards
yourself and to uphold them. There must be some way in which you are interacting
with your international colleagues to make advances in this.</p>
<p></p>
<p>So, those are the five pillars that we think about when we think about
excellence in digital governance.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I should say that it is also very important to go back to the fundamentals
and ask what is the governance in service of? What objectives are we trying
to meet? Because you cannot govern for the sake of governing; you govern
to meet objectives. Essentially there are three, and they are not very
different from the objectives that we would have when we started in 1981
and built up organisations like ISS. Firstly, it is about exciting opportunities
for growth for our people and our businesses. Secondly, ensuring trust
and safety. And thirdly, I think particularly importantly in the digital
era, is the idea of how we strengthen a sense of community and how we do
not allow the technologies that have come to define our lives to tear us
apart, but instead find ways to still bring people together and to continue
to have that sense of unity.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now these objectives are not very different from how we're thinking about
our AI plans. When it comes to growing our AI ecosystem, the ideas that
we have applied in seeking to achieve excellence in digital governance
equally apply. Where AI is concerned, some may ask, is Singapore, like
some other countries, very keen to develop our own large language model?</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On this note, I would like to share while Singapore is not associated
with aircraft technology, we have managed to develop a vibrant aviation
and aerospace hub. It has required us to think strategically about what
makes sense for Singapore.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Semiconductors, again, is the same thing. We are not very much into leading
edge chips, but overall, in terms of global supply to the world, Singapore
takes up maybe about 10%, and about 20% for semiconductor equipment. These
two serve as a good reference point for us when we think about what we
hope to achieve in developing our AI ecosystem. We are going to find those
niches that make sense for Singapore and to encourage them to the fullest
extent possible.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So, in charting our own path forward for AI, we know that AI applications
and innovations take time and resources. So, it has to make sense for the
companies that are driving these activities. They must want to have these
AI solutions implemented in Singapore. And if you think about the fact
that we already have very competitive financial services, manufacturing
and logistics sectors, the desire is there —and most intense amongst these
sectors — to do just a bit more. Hence, we are encouraging companies in
these sectors to build our AI centres of excellence, and we’ve gained a
lot of support.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But AI innovations are not solely reserved for the private sector. We
would like to see AI innovations in the public sector and for the public
good. AI and machine learning are very good for things that deliver precision
and personalisation. So, whether it is the rail system, corrective maintenance
and preventative maintenance, prescriptive medication or cancer treatments,
to a very personalised extent we are already seeing some of these innovations
take place.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All in all, we can hopefully bring these together to achieve our vision
of AI economic growth in Singapore. We hope to grow some of these AI innovations
in Singapore so that some of them may catalyse innovation elsewhere in
the world and make contributions to the broader global ecosystem.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Of course, we can't do this without your help, in particular in terms
of building up the talent pool. This is where you can see NUS-ISS play
a very important role. You already have very solid foundations over the
course of so many years. I saw from the video that you are graduating 178,000
people to a variety of programmes – some full-time, some part-time. I have
had the privilege of meeting eight of them earlier. I should say that they
are fine examples of how Singapore, far from becoming fearful that AI will
take away people's jobs and replace us, is embracing technology and using
it to enhance our own human capabilities to keep humans in the loop for
the things that matter most and continue to create ourselves a next bout
of growth, a next bout of opportunity, a next bout of progression.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>13. There are so many examples of alumni amongst you, who have challenged
themselves, surpassed their own expectations and shown the rest of Singapore
how with some determination and a lot of support, they never let technology
stop their progress or let fear stop them from achieving something new.</p>
<p>14. To conclude, I want to congratulate ISS for all the good work that
you do. Our Government agencies like GovTech and IMDA believe in contributing
in the common good. They partner with many organisations across a whole
spectrum of activities, and are already working very closely with you.
I believe that as a community, if we continue to work closely with one
another, identify the ways in which we can strengthen capabilities in Singapore,
both for individuals as well as businesses. There is no saying how far
we might go in growing our own AI ecosystem.</p>
<p>15. I congratulate all of your award recipients, your partners, as well
as the thousands of graduates that move through your doors every single
year.</p>
<p>16. Thank you very much for inviting me here.</p>
