Good afternoon Circles.Life Co-Founders, Mr Rameez Ansar and Mr Adeel Najam,<br>
<br>
My Cabinet Colleague, Dr Janil and friends,&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Introduction</span></strong><br>
<br>
1.<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>I am delighted to join you today at the launch of Circles.Life's Circles-X R&amp;D Centre in Singapore.<br>
<br>
<strong>The Importance of Research and Innovation in Creating New Economic Opportunities</strong><br>
<br>
2.<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>Bob Iger, the former CEO of Disney, once said: <em>“The riskiest thing we can do is just maintain the status quo.”</em><br>
<br>
3.<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>In a relentlessly-changing world, those who stay still soon become laggards.<br>
<br>
4.<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>This is the era of hyper-innovation; and we must continually strive to keep up to remain relevant.<br>
<br>
5.<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>Innovators such as yourselves stand a better chance to be well-positioned to seize opportunities and overcome challenges.<br>
<br>
6.<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>This is why the Singapore Government is committed to ensuring that Singapore remains a great place for innovation.<br>
<br>
<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>a.<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>Two years ago, we launched the <strong>Research, Innovation and Enterprise (RIE) 2025 Plan</strong>.<br>
<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>b.<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>25 billion dollars, or roughly one percent of our GDP, was committed to support research, innovation and enterprise, over five years.&nbsp;<br>
<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>c.<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>Part of this is being used to support R&amp;D in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">digital technologies</span> with <span style="text-decoration: underline;">strong transformative potential</span>, such as in the areas of communications and connectivity, AI, cybersecurity,&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">trust technologies</span>, and quantum computing.<br>
<br>
7.<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>Specific to the telco sector, we also have the <strong>Future Communications R&amp;D Programme</strong>, to support <span style="text-decoration: underline;">multidisciplinary</span> research efforts in future communications technologies.<br>
<br>
<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Anchoring Digital innovations here gives Singapore the potential to make waves worldwide</span></strong><br>
<br>
8.<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>With these strategic investments in R&amp;D, our ambition is to:<br>
<br>
<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>a.<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>attract more <span style="text-decoration: underline;">cutting-edge</span> tech companies to Singapore, to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">anchor</span> their product innovation and development activities.<br>
<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>b.<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>We hope to see them create novel projects with <em>global</em> impact,<br>
<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>c.<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>and generate exciting new career opportunities for our people.<br>
<br>
9.<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>We very much welcome Circles.Life as one such company, seeking to anchor innovation here while making waves internationally.<br>
<br>
<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>a.<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>It is exciting to witness your B2B-focused Circles-X operating system (CXOS) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">being</span> developed right here in Singapore,<br>
<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>b.<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>More so when it has seen some <span style="text-decoration: underline;">prominent</span> usage overseas.<br>
<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>c.<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>For example, as far as I am aware, last year, Circles-X helped KDDI, a Japanese telco, launch a new digital brand - a <em>mass customisation</em> service called Povo2.0.<br>
<span style="white-space: pre;">			</span>i.<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>Povo2.0 enables subscribers to mix-and-match various components of their telco plans, such as data, voice, and content,<br>
<span style="white-space: pre;">			</span>ii.<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>And change their plans from month to month, according to their needs.<br>
<span style="white-space: pre;">			</span>iii.<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>So it speaks to your focus on the customer experience in the telco industry<br>
<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>d.<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>Circles-X performs the critical function being the underlying technology stack:<br>
<span style="white-space: pre;">			</span>i.<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>that enables povo2.0 to offer such bespoke and flexible plans,<br>
<span style="white-space: pre;">			</span>ii.<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>at a lower operating cost.<br>
<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>e.<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>It also offers a suite of value-added services, such as AI-based tools to improve customer satisfaction.<br>
<br>
10.<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>Such innovations are why we also welcome your plans to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">expand</span> your R&amp;D footprint here.<br>
<br>
11.<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>Several agencies - IMDA, EDB and ESG – have been part of the support infrastructure to help you grow:<br>
<br>
<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>a.<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>And you acknowledged that you first started out from a start-up with three founders in a small room with no windows,<br>
<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>b.<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>to now becoming a telco brand <span style="text-decoration: underline;">operating</span> in five countries, with over 265 staff members <span style="text-decoration: underline;">based</span> in your R&amp;D Centre in Singapore.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
12.<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>With the launch of your new R&amp;D Centre, you will:<br>
<br>
<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>a.<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>create an additional 120 ICT-related jobs here, with a Singaporean core.<br>
<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>b.<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>I am also glad you intend to develop solutions to help local enterprises realise their own business potential, as they harness next-generation communications technologies.<br>
<br>
<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Government’s Role in Fostering Conducive Environment for Innovation</span></strong><br>
&nbsp;<br>
13.<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>Beyond our investments in R&amp;D, the Government is committed to fostering the right conditions for innovation to flourish in Singapore. How will we do so?<br>
<br>
14.<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span><strong>First</strong>, we will invest to further build up our <span style="text-decoration: underline;">digital infrastructure</span>.<br>
<br>
<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>a.<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>In last week’s Budget Speech, Finance Minister Lawrence Wong touched on the ways that we have been <strong>planning ahead for next bound of digital infrastructure</strong>, such as in broadband and 6G.<br>
<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>b.<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>We will ensure that our infrastructure is <strong>secure, resilient</strong> and <strong>future-ready</strong>, to support the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">proliferation</span> of innovative new products and services. Within MCI, Dr Janil is very focused on this.<br>
<br>
15.<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span><strong>Second</strong>, we must ensure that our regulatory environment remains pro-business and pro-innovation, yet provide sufficient safeguards to users.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>a.<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>For example, our <strong>personal data protection laws</strong> strike a careful balance,<br>
<span style="white-space: pre;">			</span>i.<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>enabling data innovation and data sharing,&nbsp;<br>
<span style="white-space: pre;">			</span>ii.<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>while ensuring high standards of protection for the personal data of individual consumers.<br>
<br>
16.<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span><strong>Third</strong> and equally important, we will help companies gain access to the right talents.<br>
<br>
<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>a.<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>For instance, since 2016, we have emplaced 12,000 individuals in ICT roles through our <strong>TechSkills Accelerator (TeSA) Programme</strong>.<br>
<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>b.<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>In fact, many of Circles.Life’s Singaporean employees were supported by IMDA’s talent initiatives, including the SG:D scholarships or the Company-Led Training programmes.<br>
<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>c.<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>We will be expanding TeSA to create even more opportunities for Singaporean talents to participate in our tech ecosystem, and will share more about these efforts during the Committee of Supply debates.<br>
<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>d.<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>But I should add - the real strength of Singapore is to combine the best of Singaporean core and what the world has to offer, so that we can complement all these skills and talent, and help our companies succeed the best way possible, as Team Singapore.<br>
<br>
17.<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>The industry – traditional telcos and Mobile Virtual Network Operators alike - must also actively do your part.<br>
<br>
<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>a.<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>You need to build not just the infrastructure and capabilities, but public trust and confidence, by providing innovative and secure solutions.<br>
<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>b.<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>From time to time, you will also need to refresh your approaches to nurturing talents.<br>
<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>c.<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>In that regard, I am glad that Circles.Life already has your own Circles Academy, an in-house programme to train software engineers.&nbsp;<br>
<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>d.<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>Not only do these efforts meet your own needs, they will also enrich the pool of talents in Singapore that all our businesses can draw upon.<br>
<br>
<strong>Conclusion</strong><br>
<br>
18.<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>To conclude, let me once again congratulate Circles.Life for making Singapore the home of your Circles-X R&amp;D Centre.<br>
<br>
19.<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>I wish you much more success ahead!<br>
