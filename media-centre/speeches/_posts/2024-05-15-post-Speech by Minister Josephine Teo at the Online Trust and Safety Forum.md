<p><strong>Driving Singapore’s Progress Towards a Safer Internet</strong>
</p>
<p>Dr Yang Yinping, Director for the Centre for Advanced Technologies in
Online Safety</p>
<p>Colleagues and friends</p>
<p></p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Thank you for inviting me to speak at today’s Forum.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This time last week, I was on a train from Washington DC to New York.
I had been on a panel at an AI Expo organised by the Special Competitive
Studies Project and was due to speak on the first-ever Global Roundtable
on Capacity Building on ICT Security under the auspices of the United Nations.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At international conferences on all aspects of digital development, there
is often an underlying question, of how our economies can benefit from
widespread use of technologies, while our societies are shielded from their
worst excesses.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Concerns around risks of AI have become especially prominent, even as
we are still grappling with the ever-growing cyber risks.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A giant of sci-fi, Arthur C Clarke: wrote in his most famous book &lt;2001:
A Space Odyssey&gt; that “Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable
from magic”.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can present-day experiences with digital technologies be described as
magic? I think the answer is yes, in many ways. But ask any scams victim,
the parent of online child sexual abuse, communities targeted by hate speech
or voters besieged by disinformation. It’s hard to feel magical anymore.
The sense that we sometimes get is one of bewilderment, anger and potentially
despair.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even if we have not personally encountered the worst online harms, their
prevalence must surely take a toll on our collective sense of well-being.
A sampling of news that have become commonplace to the point that we may
even have become immune to it:</p>
<p>a. In 2021, a 25-year-old influencer from China, who was suffering from
depression, was egged on by her followers to drink pesticide during a live-streamed
video. She died the next day.</p>
<p></p>
<p>b. In December 2023, a child in Texas allegedly died by suicide following
cyberbullying. When he passed away, he appeared to be online and was still
wearing a gaming headset. The suspected perpetrator was another boy in
another state, Michigan, i.e. more than 1000 miles away.</p>
<p>c. In Singapore, many of us have come across deepfake videos that feature
our political leaders supposedly advocating investment schemes with guaranteed
returns.</p>
<p>d. My image too has been used in scams, so it is not unusual if you feel
like you have seen me before, when I asked you to ‘buy something’ or ‘believe
in something’.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It was therefore not surprising that when MCI conducted an Online Safety
Poll in 2023, about two-thirds of Singapore users said they had encountered
harmful online content, with the most common being cyberbullying (29%)
and sexual content (28%).</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On a global level, The World Economic Forum’s Global Risk Report 2024
has identified AI-driven misinformation and disinformation as the top global
risk over the next two years.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These findings underscore the pressing need for concerted action to address
online harms and protect our communities. There is one risk in particular
that we must fight, and that is the growing sense of helplessness and simultaneously,
pushback against reasonable attempts to tame the beast.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This has sometimes been seen through blanket rejection of new laws and
regulations, especially in regard to misinformation and disinformation,
through distorted arguments about their chilling effect on free speech,
for example, or insinuations that they are instruments for silencing critics.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These accusations can be a formidable barrier against meaningful action.
There is little governments can do to except to build trust with citizens,
through serious efforts to activate stakeholders to collectively identify
counter-measures that work, and engage the public to seek understanding
and support. This has in fact been Singapore's approach.</p>
<p><u>Singapore’s approach towards building online trust</u>
</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Singapore has consistently adopted an accretive and multi-pronged approach
to build trust and safety in our digital spaces.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Instead of relying on big-bang legislation, we have taken steps to develop
guardrails and build foundations as we go along.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As early as 2012, we introduced the Personal Data Protection Act - a set
of rules on how personal information should be handled. The PDPA exemplifies
our pro-innovation data regime, protecting personal data but also promoting
legitimate uses.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We passed the Cybersecurity Act in 2018, and was one of the first jurisdictions
in the world to introduce such legislationsto protect our critical information
infrastructure (CII) against cyber threats.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Just last week, we amended the Act to stay ahead of newly emerging cybersecurity
challenges. The amended Act requires CII owners to report more types of
incidents including those that happen in their supply chains, and allows
CSA to manage entities beyond CIIs.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 2019, we introduced the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation
Act (POFMA).</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We then introduced the Online Safety (Miscellaneous Amendments) Act in
2022 to better protect Singapore users from harmful online content on services
such as social media platforms, and passed the Online Criminal Harms Act
last year, to deal more effectively with online activities that are criminal
in nature.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition to legislative measures, Singapore has prioritised empowering
individuals with the knowledge and skills to navigate the digital landscape
safely.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Initiatives such as the National Library Board's S.U.R.E program and the
Digital Skills for Life framework that was launched earlier this year help
to equip our citizens with tools to critically evaluate information and
protect themselves from online threats.</p>
<p><u>Launch of CATOS</u>
</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Government’s consistent belief is that Singapore’s approach to building
trust and safety online must be grounded in knowledge and understanding
of the transmission mechanisms, and how the design of systems and services
can lead to unintended consequences.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We must have the ability to detect these risks as well as to research
the effectiveness of mitigating measures. We must also recognise the effects
of local context, where observations in Singapore may not mirror those
elsewhere.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These considerations have led us to invest in growing our own research
capabilities. In 2022, we launched the Digital Trust Centre (DTC) to promote
research, translation, and talent development in trust technologies.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DTC focuses on trusted data sharing and computation, digital identity,
and algorithms to evaluate the trustworthiness of systems. It aims to strengthen
Singapore’s role as a trusted hub in the digital economy.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An equally important and complementary effort will be through the Centre
for Advanced Technologies in Online Safety, or CATOS, which I’m happy to
launch today.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A centre hosted by A*STAR, CATOS will be another useful tool in our arsenal
in the battle against online harms, and will inform our efforts to make
the Internet a safer place for our citizens.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CATOS, which has been about a year in the making, demonstrates:</p>
<p>a. Singapore’s belief that technology can do good; and that we can leverage
technology to overcome human limitations; and fight the harms of technology
with technology.</p>
<p>b. CATOS also demonstrates our confidence in our research community; and
that by gathering the top minds here and around the world, we can develop
innovative approaches to address the challenges of our time.</p>
<p>c. Many of the technological capabilities developed in CATOS will help
detect online harms in our local and regional contexts.</p>
<p>d. For example, recent tests have shown that the CATOS-developed analysis
engines were able to accurately detect intense emotions, such as fear,
anger and sadness, and the presence of hate speech in online expressions
collected from popular social media and online platforms. You may ask,
we as humans can detect that too, so what would be the value of this? I
think it is because the tools can potentially address the problem of pervasiveness
of harms. These tools can potentially help to flag polarising exchanges
before they cause escalation in tensions in places that we least expect.</p>
<p>e. It is likely that the tools we use can also be adapted for other contexts,
and allow us to use Tech for the Public Good, not just in Singapore, but
to benefit societies elsewhere.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, the Government has committed a total of $50 million dollars
to fund CATOS over five years. The mission of CATOS is to develop cutting-edge
technologies that prevent, detect, and mitigate online harms.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This ranges from misinformation, online hate and discrimination, harm
to health and well-being, and threats to personal and community safety
– all of which are crucial to ensuring our sense of well-being when engaging
online. I’m told we will be able to see demonstrations of CATOS’ work in
the showcase outside.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Collaboration is also high on CATOS’ agenda. It will work with partners
to develop an Online Trust and Safety sandbox for stakeholders to access
and trial new tools for detecting various forms of online harms.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our aim is to accelerate the growth of the online trust and safety ecosystem
here in Singapore, through agile and timely collaboration, joint experimentation
and fine-tuning of solutions.</p>
<p>a. Let me share an example of how this is already happening. CheckMate
is a fully home-grown, volunteer-driven initiative to counter misinformation.
It allows anyone who wishes to check or report a dubious message to send
it to a WhatsApp number.</p>
<p>b. Behind the scenes, CheckMate uses a combination of machine learning
and crowdsourcing to assess the information and respond to the query accordingly.</p>
<p>c. CATOS will be partnering CheckMate to explore technologies and tools
that can help CheckMate and its group of volunteers to fact-check more
quickly, effectively, and at scale. In other words, it should be able to
deal with not just a few queries, it needs to be able to follow up on multiple
queries at the same time at scale and accurately, in order for people to
feel that they can rely on the tools.</p>
<p>d. If and when they succeed, we as WhatsApp users can have an added means
of checking suspicious messages, anytime, anywhere.</p>
<p><u>Conclusion</u>
</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let me conclude my remarks.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Colleagues and friends, the scale and complexity of online harms demand
a concerted and coherent response from all stakeholders.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CATOS will be a platform for constructive partnerships between key players
of the online trust and safety ecosystem in Singapore.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Regardless of which organisation you represent – whether it is a government
agency, social media platform, trust and safety service provider, academic
institution, or NGO – I encourage you to be part of this platform and help
make the Internet a safer place for all.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you very much for being here.</p>
