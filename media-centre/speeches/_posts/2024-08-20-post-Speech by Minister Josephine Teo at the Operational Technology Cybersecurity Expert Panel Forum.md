<p>Distinguished panellists</p>
<p>Colleagues and Friends</p>
<p><strong><u>Introduction</u></strong>
</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Thank you for inviting me to join you again at the OTCEP forum.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For several years now, we have met annually to talk about the cybersecurity
of Operational Technology, OT. Life as we know it today is supported by
OT in multiple ways. OT does not make headlines like Artificial Intelligence
or Quantum technology, but it is what keeps the lights on, our water flowing,
our trains running and many of the modern conveniences we depend on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We know that OT systems are increasingly under threat. They have traditionally
been safe from cyber-attacks because they were placed in protected environments
and had limited connection to other networks. However, this is no longer
the case and will need to do more to protect their safety and resilience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While the recent CrowdStrike disruption was not a cyber-attack, it demonstrated
the criticality of OT systems, and the importance of resilience. Around
the world, critical infrastructure such as airports and metro systems were
disrupted to varying degrees.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Singapore, while government and most essential services were unaffected
by the outages, some businesses’ operations were affected. These included
disruptions to passenger check-in for some airlines at Changi Airport Terminal
4 and gantry operations at some public housing carparks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My Ministry has set up a Taskforce to draw lessons from this incident
to improve our security and resilience. Even before we conclude our findings,
one thing is already clear. As is true in an increasing number of cases,
an IT issue has spilled over to the OT space.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is no longer a surprise that malicious actors target OT systems. Following
the discovery of PipeDream and other Industrial Control Systems, or ICS,
malware, Dragos recently shared information on a new ICS malware called
FrostyGoop.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FrostyGoop was apparently used earlier this year to disrupt heating services
in Ukraine. As a result, many people had to endure sub-zero temperatures
within homes and workplaces. FrostyGoop is the ninth dedicated ICS malware
discovered to date, and we expect many more to come.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>OT cybersecurity poses a real challenge to all of us. This is why the
Cyber Security Agency of Singapore launched the first OT Cybersecurity
Masterplan in 2019, to set out the key initiatives that Singapore would
take to strengthen OT cybersecurity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since then, we have deepened our bench of cybersecurity professionals.
CSA developed the OT Cybersecurity Competency Framework and has successfully
organised more than 10 OT cybersecurity training courses, benefiting more
than 400 OT cybersecurity professionals from across the local ecosystem
and in the region.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We have also strengthened intelligence sharing through the joint establishment
of the OT Cybersecurity Information Sharing and Analysis Centre (OT-ISAC)
with the Global Resilience Federation Asia-Pacific. The Centre currently
has more than 40 members from the government, critical system owners and
industry providers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But we must do more to keep pace with the changes in the OT threat landscape.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong><u>OT Cybersecurity Masterplan 2024: Charting the next bound of Singapore’s OT Cybersecurity</u></strong>
</p>
<ol start="13" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Today, I am happy to announce the launch of the<strong> OT Cybersecurity Masterplan 2024</strong>,
and to share three key areas in this updated Masterplan. They are:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>a. To uplift the cybersecurity posture of all OT operators,</p>
<p>b. To deepen our cybersecurity capabilities, and</p>
<p>c. To reduce risks and vulnerabilities through security by design and
deployment.</p>
<ol start="14" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Let me say more about each of these areas.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong><u>Uplift the cybersecurity posture of all OT operators</u></strong>
</p>
<ol start="15" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><u>First</u>, we will uplift the cybersecurity posture of all OT operators,
not just CII operators.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As organisations leverage new devices – such as Industrial Internet of
Things (IIoT) devices, to support their OT operations – the Government
will do its part to provide guidance on addressing OT-related cybersecurity
risks. CSA has contributed to the development of international technical
references that set out best practices to secure cyber-physical systems
for buildings infrastructure.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>a. CSA will be updating our existing guidelines and handbooks for organisations
to include these best practices to address OT-related risks.</p>
<p>b. I encourage everyone to make use of these resources. We also welcome
feedback from the industry on how we can continue to update and refine
our best practices.</p>
<p><strong><u>Deepen cybersecurity capabilities</u></strong>
</p>
<ol start="17" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><u>Second</u>, we will strengthen the capabilities of cyber-defenders.
Malicious actors will continue to evolve their tactics, and our best defense
is to nurture a critical mass of OT cybersecurity talent with deep skills
who can mount effective counter measures.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>a. CSA has worked with partners such as cybersecurity training providers
and Institutes of Higher Learning to expand the suite of available courses
to cater to the needs of existing and aspiring OT cybersecurity practitioners.</p>
<p>b. The target audience includes professionals working in government agencies
as well as the private sector, those operating CIIs as well as non-CIIs.</p>
<ol start="18" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>I am pleased to announce today that CSA will be partnering with<strong> SANS Institute</strong>,
to provide more training opportunities for Singapore-based cybersecurity
practitioners. With this partnership, in place, the community will have
access to expert knowledge on training, workforce professionalisation and
cyber exercises.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Additional initiatives include providing greater clarity on the career
pathways in OT cybersecurity. More updates will be provided in due course.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Partnerships are also key to sharpen our technical capabilities and situational
awareness of the threat landscape.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>a. I am therefore pleased that CSA will be partnering with global cybersecurity
solutions provider <strong>Fortinet</strong> on cyber threat intelligence
sharing and capability development.</p>
<p><strong><u>Systematically reduce risks and vulnerabilities through design and deployment parameters</u></strong>
</p>
<ol start="21" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><u>Third</u>, to improve OT cybersecurity, it is important for security
to be incorporated upstream in the design and deployment of OT systems.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>a. An OT system typically comprises different products, each produced
by different Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs). These different products
are subsequently assembled and maintained by yet another different entity!</p>
<p>b. It is therefore important that OT systems come with security features
and controls. They must also be designed, implemented and subsequently
maintained in a systematic and holistic manner which reduces vulnerabilities
and risks throughout their lifecycles. In other words, OT systems need
to be “Secure by Design” and “Secure by Deployment”.</p>
<ol start="22" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>To be “Secure by Deployment”, the different parts of the supply chain
must come together.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>a. I am heartened that 14 OEMs and cybersecurity solution providers have
committed to adopt “Secure by Deployment” principles.</p>
<p>b. They are international players, so we hope that this initiative will
not just benefit Singapore but will have a wider impact subsequently as
the best practices become more widely adopted.</p>
<p>c. You will be introduced to these 14 OEMs later, and I look forward to
even more industry players stepping forward to join this endeavour.</p>
<p><strong><u>Conclusion</u></strong>
</p>
<ol start="23" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Let me conclude. We have said often enough that cybersecurity is a team
effort. Our updated Masterplan is the product of extensive consultations
with over 60 partners and experts in the OT ecosystem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In fact, many of you in this room have been part of this co-creation journey
with us. On behalf of the Government and CSA, I want to express our appreciation
to all of you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There will be risks and opportunities in tackling the OT cybersecurity
challenge, but I am confident that we can make progress by pooling our
efforts and partnering one another.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I wish all of you an enriching Forum. Thank you.</p>
