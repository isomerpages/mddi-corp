<li>
<p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you very much to Ms Kate Brandt
for the introduction, and for the lecture as well. I’ve been to Google
a few times, and every time I come here, I feel like I learn something
new — today is no different. Unfortunately, it seems like every time I
come here, I’ll have to take a quiz. I thank Google for inviting me here
today. It is my pleasure to be with all of you.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let me pick up from a point that Ms Brandt made in her presentation, which
is about AI. Singapore launched our National AI Strategy 2.0 in December
last year. NAIS 2.0 sets out our refreshed strategy to propel Singapore
as a leader in AI to realise its enormous transformative potential. We
are making ambitious investments under NAIS 2.0, including investing up
to $500 million to enable access to compute for AI innovation.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The pace of AI development since then has been relentless. AI tech and
adoption continue to grow swiftly. Just last month, Google launched a slew
of AI products including Veo, a generative AI model that creates videos
from text prompts, while OpenAI released GPT-4o. These developments signal
the dynamic growth and rapid democratisation of AI. They only reinforce
our resolve to harness AI for the Public Good, both for Singapore and the
world.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The growth of AI is a striking example of the opportunities data centres
enable us to capture. To similarly harness other trends like digitalisation
and the growing use of autonomous systems, we must grow the data centre
capacity that houses compute powering these trends. Yet with energy and
carbon constraints, data centre capacity can only grow by redoubling efforts
to make data centres more sustainable.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This challenge is not unique to Singapore. Eventually, all of us — wherever
we are around the world — are going to be faced with these constraints.
But for us here in Singapore, we’re reaching this point of consideration
because of our size and resource constraints. Because of who we are, we
are determined to turn these constraints into opportunity: opportunity
to innovate, so that we capture value from the growth of data centres while
meeting our international climate commitments.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hence, last year, our Digital Connectivity Blueprint spelled out our intent
to map a path for the growth of green data centres and push the sustainability
envelope. For that Blueprint, data centres were only one part of the puzzle
— there are other elements such as satellite connectivity, subsea cable
connectivity, as well as the software that rides on all these things. Our
Green Data Centre Roadmap, launched last Thursday, continues this effort.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Roadmap charts a pathway for the continued and sustainable growth
of data centres in Singapore. It supports our ambitions for the digital
economy and NAIS 2.0. It does so in two broad ways. Firstly, to accelerate
data centres’ energy efficiency and use of green energy. Secondly, to facilitate
data centres in catalysing partnerships and fostering collaborative solutions
across the wider data centre ecosystem. So the first way is about making
data centres better: whether it’s about data centres using first-in-class
efficient equipment or refreshing their equipment, the software, the power
and water utilisation, and raising the temperature. The second one is about
partnerships with solution providers to design and operate data centres
more efficiently, with energy suppliers to bring in green energy pathways,
and with enterprise end-users to adopt best practices for energy efficiency.
In every industry that has had to undergo such shifts, the acceleration
of the shift only occurs when everybody in the entire value chain is singing
to the same tune. The value chain then starts to shift significantly. We
see this already in many industries, so there’s a playbook for this, and
we want to apply this to the data centre ecosystem.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are many actions data centres can take to be more sustainable, even
in Singapore’s tropical climate. For example, operating at higher temperatures
helps to reduce the energy needed for cooling and makes a data centre more
energy-efficient. And Google is already doing so in Singapore, which has
contributed to bringing their data centres’ PUE below 1.2. Colocation providers
like Digital Realty have also convinced their customers to operate at higher
temperatures, and as a result, have realised significant energy savings.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One of my portfolios is to work with the Government Technology Agency
to coordinate what we do for IT across government — building products and
running the compute and data centre services for Singapore. GovTech too
is an early adopter of this approach. I am pleased to share that GovTech
has successfully trialled the Tropical Data Centre standard at one of its
data centres. Increasing operating temperatures by 2 degrees Celsius and
reducing the energy required to operate the data centre cooling infrastructure
by 40% on average, while keeping within the IT equipment’s operating temperature
range. GovTech is now exploring similarly raising the operating temperature
at other data centres. I’m glad that Google has set a standard, and that
in the public sector, we have been able to demonstrate our commitment to
the sustainable approach in the development of data centres as well.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We will continue to support data centres to be more energy efficient,
including by adopting the Tropical Data Centre standard. Data centres can
tap on incentives like the Resource Efficiency Grant for Emissions to support
upgrading.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, sustainability is not just the data centres’ responsibility.
Data centre end-users have an important role to play to drive sustainability
improvements. They can take relatively simple actions like installing energy-efficient
IT equipment, such as Energy Star certified equipment, and using techniques
like virtualisation to optimise the efficiency of their servers. Just as
we’re helping from a facility perspective, we will help end-users on this
journey. As announced at this year’s Budget debates, the Energy Efficiency
Grant will be extended the data centre sector later this year, to help
end-users accelerate their upgrade to more energy-efficient equipment.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We will also play our part. Ultimately, we must and will continue our
close partnership with industry to push boundaries for sustainable data
centre growth. For example, we are codeveloping new standards to support
upgrades. Our Infocomm Media Development Authority and our industry partners
are working hard to develop standards for IT energy efficiency and liquid
cooling, which are targeted to be introduced by the end of 2025. We will
also facilitate the industry in pushing the boundaries to deliver low-carbon
energy sources. These include bioenergy, vertical building integrated photovoltaics
or building applied photovoltaics, fuel cells with carbon capture, and
low-carbon hydrogen and ammonia.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In conclusion, we are committed to growing the data centre sector in Singapore
through being more sustainable. I look forward to partnering industry to
orchestrate this growth, and deliver the benefits of AI and digitalisation
for Singapore and the world.</p>
