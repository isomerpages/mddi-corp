<p><strong>WELCOME SPEECH BY SMS JANIL PUTHUCHEARY AT THE OPENING OF THE CYBERSG TALENT, INNOVATION AND GROWTH COLLABORATION CENTRE</strong>
</p>
<p>Mr Alex Bamford, Acting High Commissioner, British High Commission Singapore</p>
<p>Professor Tan Eng Chye, President, National University of Singapore (NUS),</p>
<p>Mr David Koh, Commissioner of Cybersecurity and Chief Executive of the
Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA),</p>
<p>Distinguished guests,</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p>
<p><strong><u>Introduction</u></strong>
</p>
<p>1. Good afternoon. I am delighted to be here at the opening of the CyberSG
Talent, Innovation and Growth Collaboration Centre.</p>
<p>2. With increasing digitalisation, cybersecurity is vital for our national
security. It is also a critical enabler for our digital economy and way
of life, as we spend more time online, being increasingly reliant on online
services.</p>
<p>3. In 2021, the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA) refreshed the
Singapore Cybersecurity Strategy to build a cyber-resilient nation. The
development of a vibrant cybersecurity ecosystem and a robust cyber workforce
were highlighted as two foundational enablers that are essential for protecting
Singapore from cyber threats and strengthening our position as a trusted
business hub. These two enablers will also create economic opportunities
for Singaporeans and Singapore-based businesses.</p>
<p><strong><u>Investing in Cybersecurity Ecosystem Growth through CyberSG</u></strong>
</p>
<p>4. With Government, industry and academia working together over the years,
our cybersecurity ecosystem and workforce have grown. Today, we are home
to more than 500 cybersecurity providers. Constant innovation is vital
in the cyber domain to counter new threats and grow new business. Companies
looking to innovate need access to talent, technology, addressable markets
and funding, and Singapore has all of these attributes. There is also a
thriving research environment here which has good synergy with industry
efforts – and this helps companies develop cutting edge applications.</p>
<p>5. For our workforce, our academic institutions offer more than 20 tertiary
level courses. This has enabled the growth of the workforce from 4,000
in 2016 to 12,000 in 2022, with over 70% being locals.</p>
<p>6. We must continue to innovate and grow our cyber talent pool as this
is the only way for us to stay ahead of ever-evolving threats and maintain
trust in the digital domain.</p>
<p>7. This is why in September last year, we announced the launch of two
national level CyberSG initiatives to further develop the ecosystem and
workforce. The first initiative is the CyberSG R&amp;D Programme Office
(CRPO) which was set up at NTU to drive research and development activities.
The second initiative is the CyberSG Talent, Innovation and Growth Plan
which included the setting up of a physical node called, the CyberSG TIG
Collaboration Centre by NUS, which is where we are today.</p>
<p><strong><u>Launch of CyberSG Consortium to spur ideation</u></strong>
</p>
<p>8. Both NTU and NUS have been hard at work since last year. I am pleased
to announce several ecosystem development initiatives by both universities
today.</p>
<p>9. The CRPO will launch the "CyberSG Consortium" initiative. This consortium
will serve as a central platform for academia, research institutes, small
and medium enterprises, and large corporations to share the latest developments
in cybersecurity research and innovation and foster ideation and development
of cybersecurity solutions.</p>
<p>10. The consortium aims to achieve several key objectives: empowering
leading enterprises with innovative solutions from academia, fostering
the exchange of new ideas between industry and academia, and sharing knowledge
and best practices through collaborative working groups. More information
on the Consortium initiative will be shared at the CRPO-organised event
on 23 July 2024.</p>
<p><strong><u>Launch of CyberSG TIG Collaboration Centre to support talent and industry development programmes</u></strong>
</p>
<p>11. Next, I am happy to be here today, for the opening of the CyberSG
TIG Collaboration Centre set up by NUS, in partnership with CSA.</p>
<p>12. The TIG Centre will work with different stakeholders in the ecosystem
to develop the talent pipeline through various manpower programmes, fund
innovative companies to serve the needs of end-users, and nurture promising
local companies to explore overseas markets and opportunities.</p>
<p>13. I would like to take this opportunity to highlight a few key initiatives.
Professor Tan Eng Chye will provide more details about them later.</p>
<p><strong><u>Developing Singapore’s cybersecurity talent pipeline</u></strong>
</p>
<p>14. Together with CSA, the TIG Centre drives a broad spectrum of CyberSG
Talent initiatives for young people and working professionals. This is
critical as we look to increase the talent pipeline, professionalise the
workforce through establishment of standards and equip non-cyber professionals
with foundational cyber knowledge. So there is an effort around people
who are identified as cyber professionals working within the industry,
and then there is a need for these types of roles, time and talent. Those
who are working in adjacent industries who do not necessarily identify
as cybersecurity professionals will still need foundational cyber learning
opportunities.</p>
<p>15. One of the talent development efforts is attracting youths into cybersecurity
by providing them with opportunities to explore cybersecurity as a career,
and exposure to relevant technical knowledge and soft skills. For example,
in June, CSA and the TIG Centre team worked with the five polytechnics
and NUS’ Women in Tech interest group to conduct six Youth Cyber Exploration
Programme (“Y-CEP”) bootcamps for close to 250 secondary school student
participants. 91 students emerged as finalists to participate in the Central
Capture-the-Flag competition held at the CISCO Singapore office. I am happy
to note that one of the all-girls teams from the Women-in-Tech bootcamp
won the third prize in the finals. We hope to increase the interest among
women to take up careers in cybersecurity, and join the cybersecurity ecosystem.</p>
<p>16. We are committed to creating opportunities for Singaporeans to pursue
a meaningful and fulfilling cybersecurity career. CSA is now leading a
study on professionalisation to enhance the quality and recognition of
the cybersecurity workforce. Inputs from stakeholders in the industry,
professional bodies, academia and government agencies will help shape the
professional framework that we are planning to develop over the next few
years.</p>
<p><strong><u>Fostering Innovation</u></strong>
</p>
<p>17. When it comes to fostering innovation, about 200 representatives from
various cybersecurity companies participated in the recent Cybersecurity
Industry Call for Innovation (CyberCall) to understand how they can provide
innovative solutions to address the challenge statements.</p>
<p>18. Amongst the awarded companies is pQCee, a local startup company that
specialises in post-quantum computing cryptography. Under the CyberCall
programme, pQCee will develop a quantum-safe public key infrastructure
(“P-K-I”) to address emerging cyber threats from threat actors capitalising
on quantum computers to exploit new vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>19. It is timely to look into this now, as today’s cryptographic methods
to secure data are likely to become vulnerable in the future, when quantum
computers become powerful enough to solve complicated mathematical problems
designed for PKIs. By transitioning to quantum-safe PKIs now, PQCee is
helping to secure a safer digital future for everyone.</p>
<p><strong><u>Helping Companies Grow</u></strong>
</p>
<p>20. Last but not least, the TIG Centre is taking steps to help cyber companies
grow. One such collaboration is with SGInnovate, who already has significant
experience in supporting the deep tech ecosystem, through ecosystem-level
initiatives like the Deep Tech Central strategy. Investments into early-stage
startups, in the form of capital and talent, are crucial to help them grow.
Together, the TIG Centre and SGInnovate can create a comprehensive support
system for cybersecurity companies, and they will be formalising their
collaboration through a Memorandum of Understanding today.</p>
<p>21. We also recognise that cybersecurity companies need cyber-specific
mentorship and access to networks to help them in their growth journeys.
Therefore, the TIG Centre will provide venture development and early scaling
support to help grow promising cybersecurity companies.</p>
<p>22. CyberBoost Catalyse is one of the programmes at the Centre that has
been designed to help cybersecurity companies at the critical stages of
their journey - often called the Growth stage. It will be co-delivered
by TIG Centre together with Plexal, who has experience in running successful
programmes like the “UK Cyber Runway” as well as the UK National Cyber
Security Centre's “NCSC for Startups” programme.</p>
<p>23. These have helped grow a new generation of cybersecurity companies
in the UK and I am delighted to share that Singapore is one of the first
countries that Plexal will expand its presence to.</p>
<p>24. The TIG Centre and Plexal will also be formalising their collaboration
through a Memorandum of Understanding later. I warmly welcome Plexal’s
partnership with NUS.</p>
<p><strong><u>Conclusion</u></strong>
</p>
<p>25. In conclusion, Singapore's commitment to strengthen and invest in
our local cybersecurity ecosystem, through CyberSG initiatives and partnerships,
will fortify our position as a cybersecurity hub in this region.</p>
<p>26. In doing so, we are not only shaping the future of the cybersecurity
industry in Singapore but are also making significant strides towards creating
a safer cyberspace for all. Thank you.</p>
