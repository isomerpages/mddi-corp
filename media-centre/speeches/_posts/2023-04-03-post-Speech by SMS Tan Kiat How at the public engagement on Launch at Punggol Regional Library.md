Mr Ng Cher Pong, Chief Executive, National Library Board  
Ladies and gentlemen  

1. Good morning and welcome to Punggol Regional Library, Singapore’s newest public library.   
  
2. I am happy to welcome you to have a sneak preview of the new Launch service ahead of the library’s official opening on 5 April. Launch is the National Library Board’s (NLB) first business resource centre that supports independent entrepreneurs, like solopreneurs and freelancers, as well as individuals to upskill. In other words, it is a service designed just for you.   
  
3. You can look forward to three key areas of support, as you plan to launch your business.  
  
4. First, you can participate in programmes that support developing business plans. These include learning how to conduct business and market research or developing your digital marketing skills.  
  
5. Second, you can get advice from entrepreneurship experts and practitioners through their Masterclasses. You can even find out how to grow your business abroad through an “Eye on Asia” series.   
  
6. Third, as building networks is important in your entrepreneurship journey, Launch will help you make connections. You can look forward to Networking Sessions, Pitch Nights, and finding a Mentor who can be your sounding board in your entrepreneurship journey.   
  
7. Apart from the vast resources and materials available, NLB also has a network of partners that will help support Launch’s Information Advisory Service. You can make use of this service to equip yourself with skills to get information on market trends, potential markets, and customers. You can book an appointment with NLB’s Launch specialists on-site here, or virtually.  
  
8. The new Launch service is part of NLB’s efforts to build a vibrant Learning Marketplace as part of its LAB25, or Libraries and Archives Blueprint 2025. Launch complements the Government’s push to support and grow the business and entrepreneurship landscape in Singapore. I encourage all of you to try out Launch’s services.  
  
9. As it is a new service, please also give us your feedback and ideas on how NLB and its partners can support you further. Ultimately, we are here to help to enhance your prospects as an independent entrepreneur.  
  
10. Thank you.
