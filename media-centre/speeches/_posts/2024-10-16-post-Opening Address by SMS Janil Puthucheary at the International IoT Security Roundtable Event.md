<p><strong>Opening Address by SMS Janil Puthucheary at the International IoT Security Roundtable Event on 16 Oct 2024</strong>
<br>
<br><strong>His Excellency Hong Jin-Wook</strong> – Ambassador of the Republic
of Korea to the Republic of Singapore</p>
<p><strong>Mr Lee Sang-Joong</strong>, President of Korea Internet &amp;
Security Agency</p>
<p><strong>Ms Barbara Kluge</strong>, Deputy Head of the Directorate-General
Cyber and Information Security, Federal Ministry of the Interior and Community</p>
<p><strong>Mr Tomoo Yamauchi</strong>, Director-General for Cyber Security
and CISO, Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, Japan</p>
<p>Distinguished Guests, Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,</p>
<p>1. Welcome to the International Internet of Things Security Roundtable.
Your presence here today – representing governments, industry leaders,
and cybersecurity experts from around the world – demonstrates our shared
commitment to addressing the challenges of securing the Internet of Things
(IoT) together.</p>
<p>2. As we pursue growth using technologies such as IoT, there needs to
be trust.</p>
<p>3. Many emerging technologies have changed how we live, work and play.
We can now monitor and control our smart homes and other IoT devices on
the go.</p>
<p>4. Smart sensors and IoT solutions present use cases at the workplace
to improve productivity and drive efficiency. There are billions of devices
worldwide now connected, and these IoT devices are exposed to cybersecurity
threats and risks. This is a room of experts, you will be familiar with
the use of botnets, as malicious cyber actors exploit vulnerable IoT devices
and infect them with malware. These are the threats and risks we face.</p>
<p>5. We have known the need to secure our IoT devices for some time. Four
years ago, at this event, I launched CSA’s Cybersecurity Labelling Scheme
for IoT devices to encourage developers to use cybersecurity to differentiate
themselves, and we ask consumers to pay close attention to IoT security.
Since its launch, more than 500 models of these devices have received a
label, and about 60% of the applications were done voluntarily. So, we
are not alone in believing that cybersecurity is a competitive advantage.</p>
<p>6. Since we launched the Cybersecurity Labelling Scheme (CLS) four years
ago, there has been stronger international traction over the need for such
a scheme. More governments and more associations are now advocating for
similar labelling schemes in their jurisdiction and pushing for more robust
cybersecurity measures to be incorporated into IoT devices. Singapore welcomes
this development; Governments must stand together and make it clear to
the industry that cybersecurity is not an afterthought, and it cannot be
an afterthought. It needs to be factored in upfront, and it needs to be
an example of security-by-design.</p>
<p><strong><u>Cybersecurity Labelling Scheme for IOT (CLS(IoT)) - Mutual Recognition Arrangements on Cybersecurity Labels for Consumer Smart Products with Korea and Germany</u></strong>
</p>
<p>7. Today, <strong>I am pleased to announce that Singapore and the Republic of Korea will be signing a Mutual Recognition Arrangement on Cybersecurity Labels for Consumer Smart Products.</strong> This
Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA) of cybersecurity labels will come
into effect in January 2025, and will cover devices intended for use by
consumers, such as smart home gateways, appliances and hubs.</p>
<p>8. This MRA is special for us because the Republic of Korea is our first
partner in Asia to formalise the mutual recognition of national cybersecurity
labels with Singapore.</p>
<p>9. In addition, <strong>I am also pleased to announce that Singapore and Germany will be signing a new Mutual Recognition Arrangement to expand the scope of our existing collaboration to include Home Gateways (also known as Wi-Fi routers).</strong> This
builds on the MRA signed between Singapore and Germany two years ago and
is part of our larger bilateral cooperation and partnership in cybersecurity.</p>
<p>10. I would like to thank all our partners for the bilateral MRAs. These
partnerships are important, and we hope to continue to have more of such
Mutual Recognition Arrangements over a broader range of devices. I would
like to encourage our partners to consider how we can collectively raise
global standards for our devices or products, and <strong>how countries can come together to establish Multilateral Internet of Things Recognition Arrangement that drives global progress towards secure IoT devices.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong><u>Launch of the Cybersecurity Labelling Scheme for Medical Device, CLS (MD)</u></strong>
</p>
<p>11. On Singapore’s part, we are also broadening our Cybersecurity Labelling
Scheme locally to key sectors, such as healthcare.</p>
<p>12. In Singapore, medical devices currently must be registered with the
Health Sciences Authority (HSA) and meet regulatory requirements, including
cybersecurity, before they can be imported, distributed and sold locally.
HSA's cybersecurity requirements are harmonised with the recommendations
set by the International Medical Device Regulators Forum - this is a group
that aims to accelerate global regulatory harmonisation and convergence.</p>
<p>13. However, as medical devices become increasingly connected to networks
at home, within the hospitals, they are potentially exposed to elevated
cybersecurity risks, there is a need to take proactive measures to enhance
the cybersecurity safeguards for medical devices.</p>
<p>14. Work has been going on for the Cybersecurity Labelling Scheme for
Medical Device since 2022. The CLS(MD) is targeted at helping consumers
and healthcare providers identify and select medical devices with better
cybersecurity. It also seeks to improve medical device security by incentivising
manufacturers to see cybersecurity as a competitive advantage and incentivise
them to adopt a security-by-design.</p>
<p>15. We launched a sandbox trial last year at this event. The trial has
provided critical insights and very useful feedback from the medical device
manufacturers. This proactive engagement has been crucial in honing the
scheme, refining how it works, setting a solid foundation for its broader
implementation.</p>
<p>16. Over the past two years, during this sandbox trial period, the Ministry
of Health, Cyber Security Agency of Singapore, the Health Sciences Authority
and Synapxe, our healthcare technology agency as part of our public sector
in Singapore, have invested significant effort to collaborate with the
manufacturers to develop the CLS(MD), working together and making sure
that the scheme's specifications and procedures are fit for the industry
and fit for the outcome that we intend.</p>
<p>17. Extending beyond the work of CLS(MD), the Global Digital Health Partnership
(GDHP), a collaboration of international government agencies and the World
Health Organisation, will be publishing their Guidance for Medical Device
Cybersecurity (GMDC) crafted based on our CLS(MD) requirements. This guidance
note will be used to guide Medical Device Manufacturers and Healthcare
Delivery Organisations worldwide on cybersecurity features to consider
when developing and deploying medical devices.</p>
<p>18. Finally, after two years of labour, I am pleased to announce the official
launch of the Cybersecurity Labelling Scheme for Medical Devices today.
I am heartened to see such strong support for this initiative, and I would
like to thank all participants and contributors for your valuable input.</p>
<p>19. I welcome more sectors to work with the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore
to develop similar Cybersecurity Labelling Scheme for your respective sectors,
and uplift the cybersecurity of more IoT devices within your sector here
in Singapore.</p>
<p>20. As I conclude, let me reiterate the importance of events like the
International IoT Security Roundtable. We have a collective journey towards
a more secure and more interconnected future. We have to engage in open
dialogue, share knowledge, and forge partnerships to secure our IoT and
a safer digital world for all.</p>
<p>21. Thank you very much for inviting me to join you here today, and I
hope you have a useful, productive and exciting roundtable.</p>
