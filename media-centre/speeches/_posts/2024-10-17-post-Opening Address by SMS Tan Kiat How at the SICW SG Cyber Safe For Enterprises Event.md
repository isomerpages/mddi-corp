<p><strong>OPENING ADDRESS BY SENIOR MINISTER OF STATE FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND INFORMATION TAN KIAT HOW AT THE SICW SG CYBER SAFE FOR ENTERPRISES EVENT ON 17 OCT 2024</strong>
</p>
<p><strong><u>SMARTER, SAFER, SIMPLER CYBERSECURITY FOR ENTERPRISES</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Distinguished guests</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen</p>
<p><strong><u>Introduction</u></strong>
</p>
<p>1. In May this year at ATxSG, I launched the Digital Enterprise Blueprint
(DEB) which sets out our ambition for the next mile of digitalisation for
Singapore’s enterprises.</p>
<p>2. Cybersecurity features prominently in the DEB. A key focus area is
to equip enterprises to be safer through improved cyber resilience even
as they embrace digitalisation.</p>
<p>3. We are building on a strong foundation. CSA has been supporting enterprises
on securing their digitalisation journeys by providing resources such as
cybersecurity toolkits, and providing funding support for SMEs through
the Cybersecurity Health Plan.</p>
<p>a. For example, CSA launched the Cybersecurity Health Plan, which is delivered
by CISO-as-a-Service providers to support organisations starting out on
their cybersecurity journey.</p>
<p>b. These providers will perform a cyber health “checkup” on organisations
and develop a plan to help them close their cyber hygiene gaps and prepare
for Cyber Essentials certification. Eligible SMEs can enjoy up to 70% co-funding
support for this service.</p>
<p>c. I am heartened that there has been steady adoption of both the Cyber
Essentials and more advanced Cyber Trust marks. To date, more than 370
organisations have attained either one of these certificates.</p>
<p>4. However, the threat landscape continues to evolve, and we need to strengthen
our tech ecosystem to support the safety of every enterprise, regardless
of how far along they are on their digitalisation journey.</p>
<p>5. Today, I will touch on three aspects:</p>
<p>a. First, we want to make it simpler for SMEs to be safer and we will
do so by harmonising our existing Government cybersecurity initiatives,</p>
<p>b. Second, on how we help enterprises adopting cloud services to be cybersecure
and we will do so by deepening our collaboration with cloud service providers
and other relevant stakeholders, and</p>
<p>c. Third, we are helping our enterprises to be smarter, by adopting AI
in their digital services and digital architecture, and how can we help
them to be cyber safe even as they do so.</p>
<p><strong><u>Being safe will be even simpler for SMEs by harmonising our initiatives</u></strong>
</p>
<p>6. Let me start on the first aspect. Adopting good cybersecurity measures
can be daunting for enterprises, especially SMEs. It requires significant
resources to manage cyber risks, and many enterprises might not even know
where to start.</p>
<p>a. According to CSA’s 2023 cyber health survey, almost 60% of both businesses
and non-profit organisations reported a lack of knowledge or experience
to implement cybersecurity effectively. 60% is quite significant.</p>
<p>b. We developed the Cyber Essentials and Trust marks as useful starting
guides for enterprises, especially Cyber Essentials which is meant for
the broad base of firms and organisations.</p>
<p>c. We will align the Cyber Essentials mark with IMDA’s SMEs Go Digital
programme to make it easier for SMEs to achieve the basic cybersecurity
hygiene standard.</p>
<p>7. Specifically, CSA, Enterprise SG and IMDA have come together to refresh
the cybersecurity category of pre-approved solutions under the SMEs Go
Digital programme.</p>
<p>8. Pre-approved solutions under the refreshed cybersecurity category will
now fall under two types of measures, “Secure/Protect” and “Backup”, which
are two of the five categories of measures under CSA’s Cyber Essentials.
Sometimes it is not a matter of if, but a matter of when. And when it happens,
to be secure and resilient, and to be able to back up and continue your
business operations is critical. Hence, this will align the scheme categories
and bring them in sync.</p>
<p>9. The refresh will also introduce a new integrated package for SMEs taking
their first steps in cybersecurity. This integrated package provides support
in multiple aspects of cyber hygiene such as virus and malware protection,
firewall, and backup. This is particularly suitable for SMEs without existing
cybersecurity solutions in place. And I believe that will be the bulk of
our SMEs. This is an important step we are taking for SMEs - especially
those that are beginning to look at their cybersecurity postures – to help
them meet their cybersecurity hygiene standards as quickly as possible,
and adopting an integrated solution that provides multiple aspects of cyber
hygiene.</p>
<p>10. For SMEs that have already begun their cybersecurity journeys, they
may also consider standalone solutions, which will include new categories
specifically for backups.</p>
<p>11. These efforts make adoption simpler, even for organisations beginning
on their digitalisation effort, while accounting for the different needs
that businesses might have. In summary, we want to make it easier for SMEs
to be cyber secure and cyber safe, even as they digitalise. Depending on
their needs and where they are in their digitalisation and cybersecurity
journey, we have packages available for them under the refreshed cybersecurity
category of pre-approved solutions under SMEs Go Digital, coming together
across different agencies and syncing up our initiatives.</p>
<p><strong><u>Being safe on the cloud will be even simpler for SMEs through CSA’s collaboration with cloud service providers and other stakeholders</u></strong>
</p>
<p>12. The next aspect is how we are supporting the safe adoption of cloud
services by enterprises.</p>
<p>13. Cloud services are more commonly adopted by enterprises. According
to IMDA’s Annual Survey on Infocomm Usage by Enterprises, almost a third
of all Singapore’s businesses are now on the cloud.</p>
<p>14. However, along with its widespread use, there has also been an increase
in cyber threats targeting the cloud. Cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike reported
a 75% increase in cloud intrusions in their 2024 Global Threat Report.
In particular, the number of intrusions carried out by actors that were
familiar with how to exploit the cloud more than doubled. As more of our
enterprises get on the cloud, we have bad actors following suit, and they
are also specialising in how to exploit the vulnerabilities in a cloud
system. And we see a rise in such incidents.</p>
<p>15. Cloud service providers have responsibility for the overall cybersecurity
of their cloud services. But all enterprises need to ensure their own security
within their own cloud environment.</p>
<p>16. This means that enterprises still need to implement the necessary
security controls and configurations to ensure that their digital assets
on the cloud remain protected. I will use an analogy – the cloud service
providers are almost like the security for the estate, but you have to
provide your security for your own house, and that is the responsibility
for each of us as homeowners. In the analogy of cloud services, each enterprise
needs to protect your own cloud environment.</p>
<p>17. It is important that businesses are equipped to work alongside their
cloud service providers to secure their use of the cloud.</p>
<p>18. Last year, CSA launched the Cloud Security Companion guides in partnership
with the Cloud Security Alliance.</p>
<p>19. These Guides make it simpler for enterprises to configure their cloud-based
solutions, and they are designed to support companies for certification
under the Cyber Essentials and Cyber Trust marks.</p>
<p>20. We had the support of major cloud service providers, namely Amazon
Web Services, Google Cloud, Microsoft, who published their guides specific
to their respective platforms. I am glad to note that Alibaba Cloud and
Huawei have joined us in publishing similar guides this year.</p>
<p>21. The top five key cloud service providers in the market now all have
companion guides. These guides complement Cyber Essentials and Cyber Trust
marks by empowering our enterprises to be cyber safe when using the cloud.</p>
<p>22. The Cloud Security Alliance has been an instrumental partner in the
success of the Companion Guides, and we are taking our partnership one
step further through mutual recognition.</p>
<p>23. I am pleased to announce that there will now be mutual recognition
for the CSA Cyber Trust Mark and the Cloud Security Alliance Security,
Trust, Assurance and Risk (STAR) certification.</p>
<p>24. In addition to the benefits of wider recognition between holders of
both certifications, this agreement will also reduce the time and effort
for STAR-certified organisations seeking certification under Cyber Trust,
as there is cross-mapping and mutual acceptance of requirements between
the certs. So it is important that organisations get on the cloud. We want
them to be able to protect their digital assets. We are also doing so by
bringing the different stakeholders together, not just cloud service providers,
but partners like Cloud Service Al, to make it easier for our enterprises.</p>
<p><strong><u>Being smart with AI can be safer for all enterprises</u></strong>
</p>
<p>25. The third aspect is how we are supporting enterprises to be cybersecure
as they adopt AI.</p>
<p>26. AI has the potential to support all manner of work, ranging from complex
data analytics to the simple use of openly available large language models
to answer simple queries.</p>
<p>27. AI is not just for sophisticated users. We expect AI to become a common
feature of all enterprises in the future.</p>
<p>28. As organisations accelerate their adoption of AI, it is important
to ensure that their use of AI is safe and secure. There are risks arising
from the use of AI as it can introduce vulnerabilities into enterprise
environments if not adequately secured. For example, prompt injection attacks
can lead to the model leaking confidential data, or manipulating the model
to produce undesired outcomes such as releasing its parameters.</p>
<p>29. However, the adoption of AI, though rapid, is still relatively nascent.
This means that organisations have the opportunity to build safety and
security into their use of AI from the start, from the outset. Because
it’s emergent, new and nascent, it is better for us to put the safeguards
in now, rather than wait till we have legacy infrastructure and start using
many of these functionalities and capabilities. It is timely for us to
act now.</p>
<p>30. This is why the Government has been working with industry partners
to improve enterprise awareness of risks, and how to implement safeguards
into our use of AI.</p>
<p>a. Nationally, we have recently released a Model Governance Framework
for Generative AI, that seeks to foster a trusted AI ecosystem.</p>
<p>b. CSA has released Guidelines and a Companion Guide on securing AI systems,
to support system owners in their adoption of AI. Inputs from relevant
local and international partners have been incorporated. We want these
guidelines to be a practical document for enterprises to reference. We
are not interested in having a very high-level, conceptual, and elegant
document with a lot of theory – that’s not our purpose. We want something
that is practical, pragmatic, and can be used easily by enterprises. That
is our intent.</p>
<p><strong><u>Conclusion</u></strong>
</p>
<p>31. In conclusion, I want to thank the partners and stakeholders who have
participated and contributed to securing our digital space, as well as
our enterprises in Singapore for your strong partnership and strong support.
We could not do this by ourselves. It is not just the Government or organisations
- it is an ecosystem coming together, which is not to be taken for granted.
It is not everywhere that you find such partnerships in different markets
and jurisdictions. The Singapore Government believes in working together
very closely. The ecosystem partners, tech service providers, companies,
associations, government regulators, and government users are coming together
for a common objective of securing cyberspace.</p>
<p>32. I thank all of you once again for your support. There is a lot more
work to be done, but we are continuing to build on the foundation, one
layer at a time. If you have ideas, feedback or suggestions, please feel
free to let my colleagues know.</p>
<p>33. I look forward to your continuous support and collaboration, and I
wish all of you a productive seminar. Thank you.</p>
