<p><strong>Speech by Mr Tan Kiat How, Senior Minister of State for Digital Development and Information, At Singapore Computer Society (SCS) Splash Forum (4 October 2024)</strong>
</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone, and a very warm welcome to the inaugural SCS Splash
Forum. It is my real pleasure to be here today.</p>
<p>Today’s theme is “Careers and Internships”, and I think it’s a very apt
theme as described by Mr Sam Liew just now. I hope that all of you here
today will embrace the many opportunities for learning, collaboration,
and growth that lie ahead.</p>
<p><strong><u>Singapore Government is committed to nurturing a skilled tech workforce amidst a changing tech landscape</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Within the evolving landscape of the tech industry, different roles and
competencies in the workplace are emerging and evolving at a rapid pace,
reshaping our understanding of work and education. We have seen this take
place most recently against the backdrop of the advent of generative AI,
or GenAI. From AI-driven coding tools to automated content generation,
GenAI has not just created new job roles, it has also enhanced the capabilities
of existing ones.</p>
<p>Sectors such as finance, healthcare, and retail, and many more, are actively
seeking tech-savvy professionals to drive innovation in areas like digital
payments, telemedicine, and e-commerce. These are exciting opportunities
for tech professionals in Singapore.</p>
<p>We have seen the demand for tech professionals in Singapore grow over
the years. The number of tech jobs grew from 155,500 in 2017 to around
208,300 in 2023, just last year. This is a compounded annual growth rate
of 5% per annum.</p>
<p>These are good jobs with good prospects. Our Infocomm Digital Technology
(IDT) university graduates took home the highest median gross salary at
$5,500 in 2023. This is compared to $2,900 for Polytechnic graduates and
$2,100 for ICT ITE fresh graduates. More generally, the resident median
wage for tech professionals was $7,000 per month, much higher than the
overall median wage for the general economy of $4,500. So, good jobs, good
starting pays, and good career prospects in the tech industry. These are
exciting opportunities for all of you.</p>
<p>In Smart Nation 2.0, which was released just a few days ago, we have said
that we intend to empower our workers to adapt, succeed, and realise their
aspirations in a changing economy. The Government will remain committed
to developing a strong pipeline of tech talent to meet our industry needs.</p>
<p>IMDA’s TechSkills Accelerator (TeSA) programme, for instance, supports
our workers’</p>
<p>transition into tech roles and ensures that our existing tech workforce
remains equipped with relevant skills. It offers targeted training, job
placements, and career support in ICT jobs. Through this, nearly 18,000
locals have been placed and trained in in-demand tech areas, and another
243,000 individuals have been upskilled.</p>
<p>And we are doing more for a specific group of graduates from ITE and polytechnics.
The TeSA for ITE and Polytechnics (TIP) Alliance is an industry-led initiative
driven by IMDA and supported by industry partners.</p>
<p>It supports the development of end-to-end pathways to strengthen Polytechnic
and ITE graduates’ employment outcomes in tech, which starts from enhanced
year-long internships while the students are still in school, progressing
to apprenticeships and work-study upgrading after graduation.</p>
<p>We started this effort two years ago because we noticed that the starting
pay of our polytechnics and ITE graduates were lagging behind the starting
pay of university graduates, and the gap was getting wider and wider. Understandably,
there is a premium attached to a university degree. But over time, we saw
that while the prospects for university graduates grew, graduates from
ITE and polytechnics did not have as much opportunities, and their salary
gap widened.</p>
<p>That was the genesis of why we started the TIP Alliance. And I'm very
glad that Mr. Sam Liew, as President of SCS, and Mr. Wong Wai Meng, president
of the SGTech industry association, have come forward to co-lead this effort
together with us. It has brought together like-minded partners from across
government, school leadership, tech industry associations and leading employers
of tech manpower such as NCS and ST Engineering. Together with representatives
from schools and different government agencies, this alliance aims to provide
students with industry-relevant skills and to help them transition from
education to employment in the tech sector.</p>
<p>Since its inception in September 2022, the TIP Alliance has been instrumental
in changing the way organisations think about hiring and developing tech
professionals, by giving sufficient weight on skills rather than just looking
at academic qualifications. As of 2024, leading employers in the TIP Alliance
have committed 800 good tech job opportunities for ITE and Polytechnics
graduates.</p>
<p>I would like to draw on three objectives we set out to achieve under the
TIP Alliance. First, to build new and alternative pathways and opportunities
around training and employment. Second, to catalyse a change in mindsets
around hiring and development. And third, to foster a vibrant ecosystem
around skills-based hiring.</p>
<p><strong><u>New and alternative pathways</u></strong>
</p>
<p>It is important that we engage students early in their education. Under
the TIP Alliance, industry partners can collaborate with Polytechnics and
ITEs to shape their curriculum, ensuring that the curriculum stays relevant
with industry trends.</p>
<p>At the same time, by starting upstream and providing students the opportunity
to take on internships, students like all of you here are exposed to how
the tech industry operates and can actively apply what you study in school
in a practical manner. And this is so important as it sets a very strong,
good foundation from the outset.</p>
<p>However, securing enriching opportunities can be challenging. Students
may find themselves in roles that do not fully utilise their skills. Schools
may find it difficult to forge partnerships that provide value to their
students, while companies struggle to find interns with industry-relevant
skill sets. The TIP Alliance has been instrumental in addressing these
issues.</p>
<p>First, the TIP Alliance has helped to facilitate longer, more thoughtfully
designed internships. This ensures that students are not just seen as temporary
help but become integral parts of the teams they join.</p>
<p>These internships are curated to balance company contribution with student
learning. Mentors also help to guide students through projects, which allow
students to develop skills and build up the relevant competencies necessary
for their careers. It's not just about technical skills; it’s also about
the softer aspects of how you work in teams, work with colleagues, address
problems, and be confident of yourselves.</p>
<p>There has been a steady supply of such internships; over 260 companies
from 13 sectors, including OCBC and Accenture, have come onboard the enhanced
internship programme.</p>
<p>I am glad to see that students recognise the benefits of such internships,
despite the need to dedicate more time to such programmes.</p>
<p>Participation in these year-long enhanced internships increased in 2024,
and I am pleased to share that more than 900 Polytechnic and ITE Students
have participated in these internships. This is double the participation
from last year. In fact, more than 1,300 students have benefitted from
these internships in the last two years.</p>
<p>I encourage for all of you, if you are about to embark on your internships,
do consider the longer 12-month internships if those opportunities are
available to you, I've met many interns at their workplace, and all had
wonderful things to say about the internship. They learned a lot and really
appreciated the opportunities.</p>
<p>Such enhanced internship programmes are valuable as they allow for on-the-job
training, allowing students to apply their skills to real-world applications
and develop soft skills for the workplace. The programme benefits organisations
too, as these internships allow firms to recognise and retain talent. So,
to employers that have not come aboard this programme - please do so. It
is a golden opportunity for you to identify talent early.</p>
<p>Take for example, Ms Evelyn Foo, who spent a year at Accenture in a software
engineer role. Evelyn performed well during her internship, and she is
now employed full-time in Accenture as a custom software engineering associate.</p>
<p>Second, the TIP Alliance has also encouraged organisations to offer apprenticeships
to promote continuous professional growth and development.</p>
<p>When properly structured, apprenticeships help to align the interests
of graduates and employers, by ensuring that graduates can excel in their
chosen fields. OCBC's Ignite programme, which was developed in collaboration
with Singapore's five polytechnics, offers tech students a structured 18-month
career pathway. This includes a 12-month internship and a six-month full-time
apprenticeship after graduation. Upon successful completion of the programme,
participants can leapfrog to an assistant manager position at the bank.
So, a win for both the students and the organisation.</p>
<p>Many of them find having such experiences rewarding. Arash Nur Iman, an
Information Technology student at Ngee Ann Polytechnic, who is currently
taking part in OCBC Ignite, shared that it was an eye-opening experience
to be able to see first-hand how things were run. In his stint, he’s had
the opportunity to interact with different groups of people and improve
his soft skills.</p>
<p>I am happy to see that our participants are enjoying the journey and making
the most of the time they have invested in these programmes.</p>
<p><strong><u>Change in mindset</u></strong>
</p>
<p>By championing a skills-based approach, we hope to steer mindsets away
from traditional academic qualifications and towards the competencies and
abilities that candidates can contribute to an organisation.</p>
<p>In November last year, we launched the Skills-Based Hiring Movement together
with the Employer Pledge and Handbook for Tech Roles, which provides guidance
for firms to attract, assess, and develop tech talent based on competencies.</p>
<p>Over 200 companies have pledged their support for the movement today,
and certain progressive companies have integrated their commitment into
their hiring practice.</p>
<p>For example, Oracle has removed the education requirement in its job postings
for technical roles in Singapore, and Accenture has adopted a multi-stage
assessment focused on skills, competencies, and growth potential. In Accenture’s
case, the move has reduced their Time-to-Hire by 75%, and increased quality
talent pipelines by 40%.</p>
<p>Such efforts help to broaden the talent pool by providing equal opportunity
to those with non-traditional backgrounds and fosters a more inclusive
and dynamic workforce. Our industry partners agree and have started to
recognise the benefits of adopting a skills-based approach.</p>
<p>CEO of Inspire-Tech, Sharon Teo, has said that embracing a skills-based
hiring mindset enabled them to build a more diverse team, and that the
diversity helped to generate fresh perspectives that improved their business.</p>
<p>We remain committed to further expanding this pool of talent, and the
TIP Alliance will be exploring further efforts to help assimilate other
individuals into the tech workforce.</p>
<p>I want to especially call the next group of individuals that we hope to
support - the gentlemen here going to National Service (NS). When you come
out of NS, many of you have different pathways, but we want to reach out
to you and provide more opportunities and options for you to consider.
If you are keen to pursue your next steps in tech, whether it is through
further studies or taking on a job, we want to be there to walk the journey
with you, together with employers.</p>
<p>Part of this would include developing relevant apprenticeship and Work-Study
Programmes to bridge the skills gap and enhancing your industry readiness
and capability to undertake available job roles.</p>
<p><strong><u>Cultivating a vibrant ecosystem</u></strong>
</p>
<p>I am very encouraged by the strong support of TIP Alliance members and
organisations that have come onboard this broad movement.</p>
<p>This is a testament of the hard work by TIP Alliance co-chairs, members,
and the individuals involved. Importantly, it speaks to the importance
of this unique Singapore approach of bringing stakeholders together to
align interests, build trust, and jointly develop pragmatic solutions to
common challenges.</p>
<p>By uniting different stakeholders, the TIP Alliance has facilitated the
exchange of knowledge and best practices, ensured that school curriculum
remain industry-relevant, and that graduates are well-prepared for the
demands of the workplace. These partnerships have also enabled the creation
of platforms for networking, mentorship, and professional development,
thus further enriching the tech ecosystem.</p>
<p>However, as we look to the future, we will have to keep pace with new
developments and scale our initiatives to meet the demand for tech talent.</p>
<p>One of the biggest challenges we face is the sheer speed of tech advancement,
which is evolving at a pace that outstrips traditional educational and
training models. We will need a more agile approach to curriculum development
and skills training, to continuously anticipate skills gaps, and develop
and integrate certifications that are valued by employers. And we will
need to do this in a collaborative manner, to ensure that the ecosystem
can grow.</p>
<p>The search for and development of top tech talent is critical for Singapore
to stay ahead of the curve. To the representatives here today on behalf
of Industry, I would like to encourage you to join the Skills-Based Hiring
movement by pledging your commitment and transitioning your hiring focus
from just looking at academic qualifications to also look at practical
competencies and skills.</p>
<p>Let’s not forget the students that are also here with us today. Your skills
are your currency in the tech job market, and I hope you will embrace the
shift towards skills-based hiring by honing the skills that employers value
most.</p>
<p>The rebranding of the Splash Awards to the Splash Forum is intended to
spark conversations between our industry partners and yourself. There will
be more networking and career opportunities for students in technical roles
such as software engineering and cybersecurity, and less tech-centric roles
such as in business analyst internships.</p>
<p>I encourage you to take the opportunity to talk to people and understand
the requirements of your desired job roles. Should you find an area that
you might be interested in, please proactively engage with the industry
members and understand the industry-relevant courses and certifications
that they are looking for.</p>
<p>SCS has partnered with Google to introduce Google Career Certificates
to their student chapter members. Through the 500 Google Career Certificates
scholarships provided by Google under the Skills Ignition SG Programme,
students have access to self-learning opportunities on the Coursera platform.
The number of registrations have almost doubled, from 700 last year to
1,300 this year. Many students have benefited, so if not done so, please
quickly do so.</p>
<p>These initiatives are meant to allow you to hone your interests, further
develop your skills, and allow you to gain hands-on experience and expertise.
For instance, Google also has its Skills Ignition SG Traineeship Programme
to help Singaporeans acquire in-demand skills for the digital future –
and the Traineeship Programme continues to evolve with the integration
of AI modules into the 2025 iteration.</p>
<p>Some graduates, such as Muhammad Syahiran Bin Abdul Jamal who joined the
Digital Marketing track last year, have seen it as a springboard to land
themselves a job. Syahiran is now at GroupM as a Search Performance Executive.
I am very glad to hear of many of such stories, where individuals, perhaps
those with more traditional IT or digital backgrounds, deciding to pivot
into the tech industry. They have secured good jobs and now enjoy very
good prospects.</p>
<p>So, it gives me encouragement, and I wish all of them the best and encourage
those of you who are thinking about it to give it a try. There are many
opportunities, many exciting development prospects, but you must take the
very first step yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Closing</strong>
</p>
<p>I end off by thanking the TIP alliance for your commitment. It is the
second-year anniversary, and we hope to have many more years ahead of us,
which means that many more years of hard work by everyone. So please give
them a round of applause. Thank you so much.</p>
