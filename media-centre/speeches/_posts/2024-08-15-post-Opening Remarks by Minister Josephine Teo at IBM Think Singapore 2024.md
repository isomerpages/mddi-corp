<p>Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, IBM Consulting, Mr
Mohamad Ali,
<br>General Manager, IBM Asia Pacific, Mr Hans Dekkers,
<br>General Manager and Managing Partner APAC, IBM Consulting, Ms Juhi McClelland,
<br>General Manager and Technology Leader, IBM ASEAN, Ms Catherine Lian,
<br>Colleagues and friends,</p>
<p>1. Good morning and thank you for your kind invitation.</p>
<p>2. It is good to be back at IBM Think Conference.</p>
<p><strong>AI REMAINS A STRATEGIC IMPERATIVE FOR SINGAPORE</strong>
</p>
<p>3. A year ago, at this conference, we discussed the tremendous opportunities
that AI presented. Much has happened since, including the launch of Singapore’s
refreshed National AI Strategy 2.0 last December, which we refer to as
NAIS 2.0.</p>
<p><em>Governance</em>
</p>
<p>4. Our foundational belief is that AI should be harnessed in a responsible
and secure way that delivers real value to our people and businesses.</p>
<p>(a) This is why we made it a priority to extend our practical guidelines
and tools for AI Governance beyond traditional AI, to also cover Generative
AI. In May, we launched our Model Governance Framework for Generative AI
and extended our open-source testing toolkit, AI Verify, through Project
Moonshot.</p>
<p>(b) In July, we also started public consultations on a set of guidelines
and a Companion Guide for Securing AI Systems – so that AI in our ecosystem
is secure by design. We would certainly welcome feedback on these new initiatives.</p>
<p>5. Recognising the importance of international partnerships on AI governance,</p>
<p>(a) Singapore led the development of the ASEAN Guide on AI Governance
and Ethics, which was endorsed at the 4th ASEAN Digital Ministers’ Meeting
in February this year.</p>
<p>(b) Two weeks ago, I also co-chaired the second US-Singapore Critical
and Emerging Technology Dialogue with Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian
Balakrishnan, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, and US National Security
Advisor Jake Sullivan. The first Dialogue was held in October last year.</p>
<p>6. The US is one of our closest partners in AI, and we have done much
together.</p>
<p>(a) This includes the first country-to-country mapping or “crosswalk”
of our AI governance frameworks, which we are extending to Generative AI.</p>
<p>(b) We are now working together on practical testing and benchmarks, which
promote interoperability and reduce fragmentations in this space.</p>

<p><em>Innovation&nbsp;</em>
</p>
<p>7. We focus on developing such guidelines, tools, and collaborations as
they help build&nbsp; trust – which is key to facilitating innovation in
our AI ecosystem. In this regard, I am glad to&nbsp;share with you that
the momentum is certainly growing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>(a) Many organisations in Singapore are expanding their AI Centres of
Excellence or&nbsp;are setting up new ones.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>(b) Businesses are using AI to fuel their digital transformation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>• A leading bank here, DBS, has already developed more than 600 AI/ML&nbsp;models
and 300 use cases, delivering economic value of S$180 million.<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(c) Within government, we appreciate the potential for AI to be used to
support the&nbsp; public good.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our very own “special forces” OGP, which stands for Open Government&nbsp;
Products, recently released an AI-enabled tool to help the elderly understand&nbsp;
the letters they receive from the government, providing simplified, clear,
and&nbsp; actionable summaries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>• Singaporeans will immediately understand why this AI tool is named&nbsp;
“ReadLiao”.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>8. IBM has been a longstanding partner of Singapore on AI, and many&nbsp;of
its efforts in capability development also serve the public good. I am
therefore happy that&nbsp; IBM and NUS intend to establish a new AI Research
and Innovation Centre.&nbsp;</p>
<p>(a) This will involve the installation of a full-stack AI system at NUS,
which will include&nbsp; IBM’s computing accelerators that are optimised
for AI workloads.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>(b) It will be the first such system that IBM is establishing on a university
campus in&nbsp; the Asia Pacific.&nbsp;</p>
<p>(c) NUS and IBM will collaborate on a range of research activities such
as Green AI&nbsp; and AI Safety, both of which align with Singapore’s priorities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>9. This project is yet another good example of how Singapore’s AI ecosystem
is steadily&nbsp;building up. We will continue to bring together industry,
government, and academia for&nbsp;meaningful partnerships that we can all
benefit from.&nbsp;</p>
<p>10. As much as we are growing our capabilities in AI, we have also set
our sights on another&nbsp; emerging area, and that is quantum technology,
so I was very glad to hear Hans mention it,&nbsp; although you didn’t have
a lot of time to elaborate, but maybe with your permission, I will say&nbsp;a
little bit more about this new frontier where we are also taking a similar
systems approach&nbsp;to growing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
