<p>Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, IBM Consulting, Mr
Mohamad Ali,
<br>General Manager, IBM Asia Pacific, Mr Hans Dekkers,
<br>General Manager and Managing Partner APAC, IBM Consulting, Ms Juhi McClelland,
<br>General Manager and Technology Leader, IBM ASEAN, Ms Catherine Lian,
<br>Colleagues and friends,</p>
<p>1. Good morning and thank you for your kind invitation.</p>
<p>2. It is good to be back at IBM Think Conference.</p>
<p><strong>AI REMAINS A STRATEGIC IMPERATIVE FOR SINGAPORE</strong>
</p>
<p>3. A year ago, at this conference, we discussed the tremendous opportunities
that AI presented. Much has happened since, including the launch of Singapore’s
refreshed National AI Strategy 2.0 last December, which we refer to as
NAIS 2.0.</p>
<p><em>Governance</em>
</p>
<p>4. Our foundational belief is that AI should be harnessed in a responsible
and secure way that delivers real value to our people and businesses.</p>
<p>(a) This is why we made it a priority to extend our practical guidelines
and tools for AI Governance beyond traditional AI, to also cover Generative
AI. In May, we launched our Model Governance Framework for Generative AI
and extended our open-source testing toolkit, AI Verify, through Project
Moonshot.</p>
<p>(b) In July, we also started public consultations on a set of guidelines
and a Companion Guide for Securing AI Systems – so that AI in our ecosystem
is secure by design. We would certainly welcome feedback on these new initiatives.</p>
<p>5. Recognising the importance of international partnerships on AI governance,</p>
<p>(a) Singapore led the development of the <strong>ASEAN Guide on AI Governance and Ethics</strong>,
which was endorsed at the 4th ASEAN Digital Ministers’ Meeting in February
this year.</p>
<p>(b) Two weeks ago, I also co-chaired the second <strong>US-Singapore Critical and Emerging Technology Dialogue </strong>with
Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, US Secretary of State
Antony Blinken, and US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan. The first
Dialogue was held in October last year.</p>
<p>6. The US is one of our closest partners in AI, and we have done much
together.</p>
<p>(a) This includes the first country-to-country mapping or <strong>“crosswalk” of our AI governance frameworks</strong>,
which we are extending to Generative AI.</p>
<p>(b) We are now working together on practical testing and benchmarks, which
promote interoperability and reduce fragmentations in this space.</p>
<p><em>Innovation&nbsp;</em>
</p>
<p>7. We focus on developing such guidelines, tools, and collaborations as
they help build&nbsp; trust – which is key to facilitating <strong>innovation</strong> in
our AI ecosystem. In this regard, I am glad to&nbsp;share with you that
the momentum is certainly growing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>(a) Many organisations in Singapore are expanding their <strong>AI Centres of Excellence</strong> or&nbsp;are
setting up new ones.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>(b) Businesses are using AI to fuel their digital transformation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>• A leading bank here, DBS, has already developed more than 600 AI/ML&nbsp;models
and 300 use cases, delivering <strong>economic value </strong>of S$180 million.<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(c) Within government, we appreciate the potential for AI to be used to
support the&nbsp;<strong>public good</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our very own “special forces” OGP, which stands for Open Government&nbsp;
Products, recently released an AI-enabled tool to help the elderly understand&nbsp;
the letters they receive from the government, providing simplified, clear,
and&nbsp; actionable summaries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>• Singaporeans will immediately understand why this AI tool is named&nbsp;
“ReadLiao”.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>8. IBM has been a longstanding partner of Singapore on AI, and many&nbsp;of
its efforts in capability development also serve the public good. I am
therefore happy that&nbsp; IBM and NUS intend to establish a new <strong>AI Research and Innovation Centre</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>(a) This will involve the installation of a full-stack AI system at NUS,
which will include&nbsp; IBM’s computing accelerators that are optimised
for AI workloads.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>(b) It will be the first such system that IBM is establishing on a university
campus in&nbsp; the Asia Pacific.&nbsp;</p>
<p>(c) NUS and IBM will collaborate on a range of research activities such
as Green AI&nbsp; and AI Safety, both of which align with Singapore’s priorities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>9. This project is yet another good example of how Singapore’s AI ecosystem
is steadily&nbsp;building up. We will continue to bring together industry,
government, and academia for&nbsp;meaningful partnerships that we can all
benefit from.&nbsp;</p>
<p>10. As much as we are growing our capabilities in AI, we have also set
our sights on another&nbsp; emerging area, and that is quantum technology,
so I was very glad to hear Hans mention it,&nbsp; although you didn’t have
a lot of time to elaborate, but maybe with your permission, I will say&nbsp;a
little bit more about this new frontier where we are also taking a similar
systems approach&nbsp;to growing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY WILL BE THE NEXT AREA OF FOCUS</strong>
</p>
<p>11. There are good reasons to believe that quantum technology may change
the world even more dramatically than AI technology. Quantum computers,
for example, could solve computing problems that are so massive that traditional
computers will take too long to solve.</p>
<p>12. There are several potential applications of quantum technology that
Singapore is keen to understand.</p>
<p>(a) The first is quantum computing. It has been said that financial models
can be further optimised to help risk analysis and portfolio optimisation;
drug discovery can be accelerated for the healthcare sector; and container
operation algorithms can be improved for logistics.</p>
<p>(b) The second is quantum communications. Like many countries we would
welcome the opportunity to better secure our communication channels against
malicious interceptions. Quantum-safe networks can also link up quantum
sensors and computers for trusted processing and communications.</p>
<p>(c) The third is quantum sensing. Quantum sensors with unprecedented precision
and sensitivity in measuring physical quantities can significantly improve
our biomedical devices as well as navigation and positioning applications.</p>
<p>13. However, like many keen observers, we recognise that there is still
some way to go before quantum technology fully matures. Nevertheless, it
is in the Singapore DNA to try and be prepared for the eventual opportunities
when they materialise. And fortunately, we are not starting from scratch.</p>
<p>(a) The seeds of our quantum strategy were planted almost 20 years ago
when we established the <strong>Centre for Quantum Technologies (CQT) </strong>at
NUS.</p>
<p>• Today, CQT is a global leader in this field, being ranked 6th globally
based on the h-index, which measures how often its publications are being
cited by others.</p>
<p>(b) The <strong>National Quantum Office</strong> was formed in 2022 to boost
and better synergise our research, innovation, and enterprise activities.</p>
<p>14. Just as we have a National Strategy for AI, we recently announced
our <strong>National Quantum Strategy (NQS)</strong>.</p>
<p>(a) Developed and driven by National Quantum Office, a further S$300 million
will be invested to strengthen Singapore’s position as a leading hub in
quantum technology over the next five years.</p>
<p>(b) Addressing the risks associated with the adoption of such new technologies
is a core part of the effort.</p>
<p>• There is increasing concern and attention on the security risks that
quantum computing may introduce.</p>
<p>• These include breaking of encryption standards that undergird our digital
communications and transactions, which we must guard against.</p>
<p>15. For today’s conference, let me highlight three key areas we are focusing
on –capabilities, infrastructure, and partnerships.</p>
<p><em>Capabilities</em>
</p>
<p>16. Our most valuable assets have always been the capabilities we build.</p>
<p>(a) We recognise there are still many challenges in developing quantum
computers –cooling, stability, and error correction – these are some of
the things that come to mind.</p>
<p>(b) But rapid technological developments in recent years have progressively
enabled quantum computing to scale and become commercially viable.</p>
<p>(c) We have therefore taken steps to be ready, and to make sure that we
have the core capabilities in place to capitalise on the potential of quantum
computing when it comes about.</p>
<p>17. For example, we set up the <strong>National Quantum Computing Hub (NQCH) </strong>to
build collaborations, capabilities, and the community that will bring Singapore
to the next era of computing.</p>
<p>(a) Researchers work closely with industry end users, domain experts,
and solution providers on use cases in areas like finance and computational
biology.</p>
<p>(b) The National Quantum Computing Hub which I mentioned is hardware-agnostic,
and continuously seeks to onboard partners that strengthen our ecosystem.</p>
<p><em>Infrastructure</em>
</p>
<p>18. It is also critical to invest in the right infrastructure early, to
reap the benefits of quantum computing, as well as mitigate its risks.
Very recently, a White House report estimated that federal agencies will
need to spend over US$7 billion in 10 years to migrate to post-quantum
cryptography.</p>
<p>(a) We are studying ways to support organisations in migrating to quantum
safe technologies, so that they are protected against quantum-enabled threats.</p>
<p>(b) In 2023, we announced the <strong>National Quantum-Safe Network Plus (NQSN+) </strong>initiative
to enable communications network operators to build nationwide, interoperable
quantum-safe networks.</p>
<p>• These networks will be progressively rolled out from the end of this
year and serve businesses in Singapore, by safeguarding their critical
data in the quantum age.</p>
<p>• This was a first step towards our broader vision of a quantum-safe Singapore.</p>
<p>• Under this initiative, Singtel announced just last week that it will
be launching Southeast Asia’s first NQSN+,<sup>2</sup> building on the capabilities
and infrastructure that they have already developed. Enterprises can leverage
Singtel's NQSN+ to protect themselves against quantum threats for their
regional operations and not just Singapore operations.</p>
<p>• Industry users can work with our participating telcos to testbed their
business-critical functions on NQSN+. We also welcome research collaborations
with our telcos.</p>
<p><em>Partnerships</em>
</p>
<p>19. This brings me to my broader point on partnerships. Apart from our
investments in capabilities and infrastructure, we are always looking to
collaborate with our global counterparts to turn challenges into opportunities.</p>
<p>(a) Earlier, I had mentioned our <strong>Dialogue with the US on Critical and Emerging Technologies</strong>.
The topics include quantum science technology, as well as post quantum
cryptography.</p>
<p>(b) Both countries have committed to continuing cooperation and exchanges,
including through industry, research, and talent development.</p>
<p>20. We also invite industry partners to work with us to develop use cases
and set standards.</p>
<p>(a) For example, one of our homegrown startups, SpeQtral, is looking to
enable secure cross-border communication using Quantum Key Distribution
(QKD) technology.</p>
<p>• It is piloting use cases both in Singapore and globally.</p>
<p>• We hope to see more of such innovation in our quantum ecosystem, which
can have broader impact on sectors like healthcare, banking, and logistics.</p>
<p>(b) But realistically, for such use cases to flourish, we will need industry
standards that build trust and interoperability.</p>
<p>• And this is why Singapore has committed to joint leadership of the first
QKD protocol standard, working together with Japan under the auspices of
the International Telecommunication Union.</p>
<p>• We welcome other partners to work with us on standards setting.</p>
<p><strong>CONCLUSION: SINGAPORE WELCOMES COLLABORATIONS WITH INDUSTRY IN EVOLVING TECHNOLOGIES</strong>
</p>
<p>21. In closing, I hope I have given you a glimpse of Singapore’s approach
towards emerging technologies. In constantly evolving areas, we are always
looking beyond the horizon, seeing what could benefit businesses and people,
and building capabilities.</p>
<p>22. We do not have a mindset of “not invented here”. If the private sector
can do some things better or has tools that work well, be it in AI, quantum,
or other areas, we want to partner you.</p>
<p>23. I look forward to the engaging discussions during the conference and
wish everyone a productive and enjoyable day ahead.</p>
