<p><strong>MOS RAHAYU MAHZAM’S INTERVENTIONS AT G20 DIGITAL ECONOMY MINISTERIAL MEETING IN MACEIÓ, BRAZIL (13 SEP 2024)</strong>
</p>
<p><u>Priority Issue 1: Digital Inclusion, Universal and Meaningful Connectivity</u>
</p>
<p><u>Priority Issue 2: Digital Government: Building a Trustworthy and Inclusive Digital Public Infrastructure</u>
</p>
<p>Distinguished Chair</p>
<p>Excellencies</p>
<p>Good morning. I would like to express Singapore’s appreciation to the
Brazilian Presidency for hosting the G20 Digital Economy Ministers’ Meeting
and for the warm hospitality. Thank you for inviting Singapore to participate
in these important discussions. I join colleagues and friends here in Maceió
in also expressing appreciation to the Chair for the excellent leadership
of the G20 Digital Economy discussions throughout the year.</p>
<p>On priority issue 1, we welcome the Presidency’s contribution to Digital
Inclusion, Universal and Meaningful Connectivity. In particular, Singapore
strongly believes that it is not just about providing people with hardware,
but also the skills to meaningfully participate online, and do so safely
and respectfully. In Singapore, we had already begun some early work in
measuring access and skills in our Singapore Digital Society Report. This
report tracks the state of digital society in Singapore and recommends
ways to build an inclusive digital society. We look forward to more cooperation
with the international community to develop indicators that can help us
sharpen our efforts in ensuring digital inclusion.</p>
<p>That said, government efforts alone will only go so far in ensuring digital
inclusion and online safety. It is crucial to work with stakeholders to
close the digital divide and promote safe, positive digital spaces. We
commend the Brazilian Presidency for working with not only G20 countries
and guests but also other stakeholders so that we can work as an ecosystem
to advance our common vision on this front.</p>
<p>I am also pleased that there has been progress on priority issue 2 on
Digital Government and Inclusive Digital Public Infrastructure. More of
our lives are moving online, and providing digital services online has
also been a game-changer in enabling access – especially to underserved
and hard-to-reach groups, such as communities in rural areas or persons
with mobility challenges. To this end, our important work and discussions
this year on open, inclusive and interoperable Digital Public Infrastructure
adds to a global effort around helping countries large and small provide
such services to their citizens.</p>
<p>A crucial part of Digital Public Infrastructure is digital identity. More
than 97% of Singapore citizens and Permanent Residents aged 15 and above
have a digital identity and transact with over 800 Government agencies
and private sector organisations across more than 2,700 services. Over
the years, we have learned many lessons in rolling out digital identity,
whether in terms of technical or security innovations, or inclusivity where
we accommodate Singapore’s four official languages. We believe that sharing
such experiences is useful as we all learn from each other in our digital
transformation journeys. We therefore welcome the Presidency’s effort to
develop general principles on the governance of digital identity, which
can be a useful best practice and standard for the international community.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><u>Priority Issue 3: Integrity of Information Online and Trust in the Digital Economy</u>
</p>
<p><u>Priority Issue 4: AI for Inclusive Sustainable Development and Inequalities Reduction</u>
</p>
<p>Thank you Chair.</p>
<p>Priority issue 3 on Integrity of Information Online and Trust in the Digital
Economy is a key concern to all countries, especially as digital technologies
are seamlessly integrated into our daily lives. The online space, while
full of opportunities, also comes with risks such as misinformation, disinformation
and scams. Technology and regulations can help us mitigate some of these
risks, but every individual must play their part in protecting themselves.
Government, industry and civil society must collaborate to promote digital
literacy, build cyber resilience and foster trust in the mobile digital
ecosystems. We commend the Brazilian Presidency for highlighting this as
a priority issue.</p>
<p>To combat misinformation and disinformation, Singapore has introduced
a suite of targeted legislative levers, including the Protection from Online
Falsehoods and Manipulation Act and the Foreign Interference Countermeasures
Act. These provide the Government with the ability to swiftly address misinformation,
disinformation, and hostile information campaigns that threaten to erode
trust in our society, including trust in our institutions and elections.
We are committed to continue building the necessary technological capabilities
to respond to the evolving threat of misinformation and disinformation.
To address these issues and other online harms, we established the Centre
for Advanced Technologies in Online Safety this year. The Centre will allow
us to develop tools to build a safer online ecosystem.</p>
<p>A secure, stable, trusted, open and interoperable cyberspace is crucial
to reap the benefits of the digital economy. Beyond regulation, public-private
partnerships are necessary to fostering trust in the digital economy. We
need continued conversations with tech companies to encourage them to do
more to strengthen their cybersecurity posture and ensure that their features
are not exploited. The Singapore Government also prioritises media literacy
and public education. These empower individuals to critically evaluate
information and protect themselves against falsehoods, including through
fostering good cyber hygiene habits.</p>
<p>AI-generated misinformation and deepfakes, especially in the context of
elections, is a growing shared concern. Like other countries, Singapore
is looking at ways to further protect ourselves against AI-generated misinformation
and deepfakes during critical periods like our elections. Early this week,
we tabled the Elections (Integrity of Online Advertising) Bill which proposes
to prohibit deepfakes and other digitally generated or manipulated online
depictions of electoral candidates, shown saying or doing something that
they did not say or do during the election period. This measure underscores
the Singapore Government’s commitment to foster a safe information space,
both during and outside of elections.</p>
<p>Singapore welcomes priority issue 4 on AI for Inclusive Sustainable Development
and Inequalities Reduction. Singapore believes in the transformative power
of AI and that AI can be used for the public good, for Singapore and the
world. Guided by this vision, we released our updated National AI Strategy
last December. The updated strategy involves active participation in AI
research and deployment, and scaling up AI for compelling use cases in
areas like advanced manufacturing, financial services, healthcare, education
and public services. The public service of Singapore has also embraced
AI. Large learning models and our own secure version of ChatGPT are used
by public officers to improve productivity. Inclusivity is a key aspect
of our National AI Strategy. AI technologies must be developed and deployed
in a way that benefits everyone including small states. In 2022, we launched
the Digital Forum of Small States aimed at providing a space for small
states to exchange ideas on our digital transformation journeys, and forge
a common digital future, including on AI governance.</p>
<p>We thank the Brazilian Presidency for the opportunity to share Singapore’s
experience and to learn from others in this G20 Digital Economy track.
Such exchanges allow us to learn from each other, and foster collaboration.
As we approach the end of this Session, may I also add my congratulations
on the very successful Digital Economy Ministers’ Meeting.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
