<p><strong>Keynote Address by Mrs Josephine Teo, Minister of Digital Development and Information, at Launch of Prudential’s Global AI Lab in Singapore</strong>
</p>
<p>Mr Anil Wadhwani, CEO of Prudential plc</p>
<p>Distinguished Guests</p>
<p>Colleagues and Friends</p>
<p>Good afternoon.</p>
<p>1. It’s great to be back at Prudential. I recall visiting about three
years ago. It was a very tough time for Singapore. We were still very much
in the midst of Covid, and the job market was so bleak at that time. All
of us wanted to find a way to bring hope, and the SG United Traineeship
Programme was a way for us to allow young graduates to jumpstart their
careers. I am glad that a good number of trainees that Prudential took
in that time are still with you. It must mean that you all did a great
job. I am delighted that this time round, we get to discuss something that
is very current, and also has the potential to be groundbreaking – not
just for the company, but also for the insurance sector at large.</p>
<p>2. Prudential’s launch of its Global AI Lab in Singapore today comes nearly
a year after Prime Minister Lawrence Wong launched Singapore’s refreshed
National AI Strategy, or NAIS2.0.</p>
<p>3. NAIS2.0 articulated the twin goals of excellence and empowerment –
for Singapore to develop peaks of AI excellence in specific sectors, including
the insurance and financial sectors, while enabling the broadest base of
individuals, businesses and communities to use AI with confidence, discernment
and trust.</p>
<p>4. One year on, we have seen much progress across the entire AI ecosystem:
in Government, Research and Industry.</p>
<p>5. Within Government, AI has been deployed in many meaningful use cases:</p>
<p>a. For example, this year, officers have been creating their own personalised
AI bots that draw on customised sets of documents and can respond to their
questions almost like experienced colleagues with deep institutional knowledge.</p>
<p>b. The Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) is developing an AI-powered
triage assistant that helps to accurately record the critical details of
an emergency call, thereby improving the speed and quality of response.</p>
<p>c. In our schools, an AI tool called “Simpler” can rephrase sentences
and use words that match students’ preferred reading levels, helping them
to more easily understand complex topics.</p>
<p>d. We are also steadily building up the AI talent pool among public agencies,
with dedicated AI teams and numerous experimentation and cross-sharing
opportunities.</p>
<p>6. Likewise, the research ecosystem has moved forward in several ways:</p>
<p>a. New research centres have been established. These include the NUS AI
Institute, the SIT-NVIDIA Centre for AI and NTU’s Centre of AI for Medicine.</p>
<p>b. Our students won two of four gold medals awarded at the inaugural International
Olympiad for AI.</p>
<p>c. In October, Prime Minister Wong announced a S$120million “AI for Science”
programme to promote inter-disciplinary collaborations and help our researchers
push the limits of scientific discovery.</p>
<p>d. Our researchers have published widely at top AI conferences. Soon,
Singapore will also be hosting two major conferences for R&amp;D leaders
in AI. These are</p>
<p>i. the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) in
2025 – a well-known event within the community of AI experts; and</p>
<p>ii. the Association for the Advancement of AI Conference (“Triple AI”)
in 2026.</p>
<p>7. In addition to all that is happening within the Government and research
communities, I’m personally very encouraged that our industries are also
stepping up enthusiastically to make good use of AI, to raise productivity,
create value, and be more competitive.</p>
<p>a. There is a growing culture of AI experimentation and innovation. Initiatives
such as Google AI Trailblazers have helped to catalyse action by early
adopters. We have seen them identify real-world challenges that can be
addressed with generative AI, build prototypes and bring these prototypes
to production.</p>
<p>b. Companies, start-ups and researchers are coming together to develop
AI solutions that address common use-cases and problem statements – with
the aim of scaling their successes across the region.</p>
<p>c. For example, A*Star set up the “AI Centre of Excellence for the Manufacturing
Sector”. It brings together research experts and industry practitioners
to develop AI-based solutions in areas ranging from product design and
quality assurance, to industrial automation and predictive maintenance.
Companies such as Coca Cola and Phillips have signed up to be part of this
effort.</p>
<p>d. Local industry champions like SIA and DBS are actively investing in
AI development. More companies including Lilly and AvePoint have set up
or are setting up AI Centres of Excellence in Singapore, to develop new
AI-enabled products and services, as well as transform their own operations.</p>
<p>8. I am happy that Prudential is similarly launching its Centre of Excellence
in AI today. This will add to the increasingly vibrant AI ecosystem in
Singapore.</p>
<p>9. I understand the AI lab plans to work on exciting problem statements
that seek to understand customers better, deliver a better experience for
them, and yield meaningful business impact. It is impressive that over
the past 3 months, the AI lab has already identified over 100 practical
use cases. These include adjudicating claims and answering customer queries
with speed and empathy.</p>
<p>10. As a Centre of Excellence, Prudential’s success can be a showcase
of AI value creation within the finance sector, not just in Singapore but
worldwide. That is why I am glad that your AI solutions developed here
may be scaled up elsewhere, to impact your operations, services and products
across Asia and Africa. This aligns very much with how we see the AI ecosystem
in Singapore, as a boost to businesses locally and globally.</p>
<p>11. I can assure you that the Singapore government will continue to support
AI innovation with enabling policies, frameworks, and sandboxes. We will,
at the same time grow the breadth and depth of AI talent to sustain capability
development initiatives such as yours.</p>
<p>12. There is no question that we are excited about the immense promise
of AI. Equally, there should be no doubt about our commitment to responsible
AI use. It’s clear that we are serious about ensuring that AI systems are
designed with fairness, transparency and accountability. We believe that
businesses developing AI use cases must make every effort to mitigate against
risks of bias, protect sensitive personal data, and retain customers’ trust.
When companies use AI responsibly, they not only create value for customers
and shareholders, they also help build public trust in AI. This is essential
as the technology is being deployed much more widely.</p>
<p>13. In this regard, we actively pursue international partnerships and
contribute where we can.</p>
<p>a. With the US, we have a dialogue on Critical and Emerging Technologies
which has allowed us to identify areas of collaboration. AI safety is one
of those areas. In fact, as we speak, in San Francisco, there’s a meeting
of AI Safety Institutes as a network, and Singapore is one of the few countries
that are represented at this network.</p>
<p>b. With China, we have a Digital Policy Dialogue that has gotten off to
a good start. We are both interested in managing the risks of AI, especially
when it comes to content that affects societal harmony and cohesion.</p>
<p>c. Besides the US and China, we worked with ASEAN colleagues on a Guide
on AI Governance and Ethics. We also recently signed a new Memorandum of
Cooperation with the United Kingdom on AI safety. With Rwanda, we jointly
published the AI Playbook for Small States.</p>
<p>14. At the same time, we continue to support businesses in responsible
AI development and implementation. We cannot just talk about responsible
AI; there must be some way of testing the responsibility of AI systems
and to provide frameworks to give assurance to users. Examples include
the Infocomm Media Development Authority’s Model AI Governance Framework
and Project Moonshot, as well as the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore’s
Guidelines and Companion Guide on Securing AI system. These resources offer
pragmatic, easy-to-use guidance for enterprises, covering best practices,
risk management, and security considerations. We encourage businesses to
make good use of them. At the same time, we are also working with our international
counterparts to make these kinds of guides more interoperable, so that
companies do not have to always struggle with knowing what standards to
meet when they cross borders.</p>
<p>15. On this note, I am heartened that Prudential shares our commitment
to AI safety, as it is a member of the AI Verify Foundation. By participating
in the Foundation, Prudential is helping to advance efforts to develop
global standards and best practices for responsible AI.</p>
<p>16. In closing, I look forward to seeing the meaningful contributions
from Prudential’s AI Lab. I wish you every success!</p>
<p>17. Thank you.</p>
