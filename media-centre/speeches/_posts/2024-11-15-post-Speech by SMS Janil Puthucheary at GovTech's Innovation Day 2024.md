<p><strong>OPENING ADDRESS BY DR JANIL PUTHUCHEARY, SENIOR MINISTER OF STATE FOR DIGITAL DEVELOPMENT AND INFORMATION &amp; HEALTH, AND MINISTER-IN-CHARGE OF GOVTECH AT INNOVATION DAY 2024 ON 15 NOV 2024</strong>
</p>
<p>1. Good morning everyone and welcome to Innovation Day.</p>
<p>2. There are many exciting highlights today:</p>
<p>a. Our officers will be showcasing their prototypes developed under the
LAUNCH! programme. LAUNCH! is a new innovation programme spearheaded by
GovTech in collaboration with various agencies and industry partners, including
AWS, Databricks, Microsoft, Outsystems and Snowflake.</p>
<p>b. Similarly, participants from the inaugural AI Champions Bootcamp (ABC)
will also be showcasing the prototypes they have developed to address problems
in their agencies.</p>
<p>c. We also have the Finale of the Data &amp; AI Tournament’s Prompt Royale
competition. This is the largest whole-of-government prompt engineering
competition for public officers.</p>
<p>3. What you see here today is an illustration of our National AI 2.0 vision:
to enable Singapore's citizens, businesses, and public sector workforce
to use AI confidently, responsibly, and creatively. Specific to the Government,
we hope to empower our officers with the AI skills to make a difference
within your agencies and across Singapore.</p>
<p>4. Today, I am thrilled to see how far we’ve come—not only in skills at
scale, but with the right problem-solving spirit, and with the support
of our private and public sector stakeholders.</p>
<p><strong>Expanding AI <u>Skills </u>at <u>Scale</u> Across Government</strong>
</p>
<p>5. Today’s event is the culmination of the efforts of thousands of officers
from over 75 agencies over the past few months. The prototypes you see
today are an illustration of how Government agencies and officers have
enthusiastically taken up the call to develop and apply their AI skills
at scale.</p>
<p>6. Take for example the Data &amp; AI Tournament (DAT), which has grown
significantly over time to include Prompt Royale today.</p>
<p>a. The DAT started in 2018 with about 400 officers from 30 agencies. In
2023, GovTech introduced Prompt Royale as part of the DAT. This is a prompt
engineering track which enables participants to deepen their prompt engineering
skills.</p>
<p>b. This year, over a thousand officers from 75 agencies took part in Prompt
Royale including 11 AI workshops organized by GovTech. These sessions focused
on hands-on skills for prompt engineering, AI chatbot design, and practical
AI tools for everyday use.</p>
<p>c. Through the Prompt Royale tournament, we have seen participants applying
their prompt engineering skills to a wide range of problems, from streamlining
communication, to creating engaging content, and even tackling complex
data analysis.</p>
<p>7. Similarly, under the LAUNCH! programme, we have gathered more than
600 ideas from public officers, supported 16 agency-led Ideathons and ran
3 hackathon sprints to develop 26 innovative prototypes to solve agency
problems.</p>
<p><strong>Fostering the <u>Spirit </u>of Problem Solving through AI</strong>
</p>
<p>8. This brings me to my next point, which is the spirit of problem solving.
We use AI not for the sake of doing so, but to solve problems that our
agencies and officers face.</p>
<p>9. The design of the inaugural AI Champions Bootcamp (ABC) was thus focused
on this spirit of problem-solving. In 12 intensive weeks, bootcamp participants
learn about advanced prompting techniques and how to build LLM pipelines
based on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and agent-based frameworks.
Most importantly, participants identify problem statements in their agencies
and develop fully working prototypes by the end of the bootcamp.</p>
<p>10. For example, Workforce Singapore (WSG) officers faced the challenge
of having to manually evaluate job descriptions of roles for mid-career
individuals under the Career Conversion Programme. To address this, WSG
developed a tool incorporating Large Language Models (LLMs) to streamline
the evaluation process, resulting in up to 78% time savings. This in turn
freed up the officers’ time to take on other value-adding tasks such as
engaging more companies to onboard the programme and ultimately improving
the outcomes of the programme.</p>
<p>11. I am very encouraged by how our officers have leveraged their skills
through the bootcamp to turn ideas into solutions that address real agency
challenges. I am certain that they will bring this problem solving spirit
back to their agencies and their day-to-day work.</p>
<p><strong><u>Support</u> from Agency and Industry Stakeholders</strong>
</p>
<p>12. The activities we see today are part of GovTech’s efforts to drive
innovation and uplift Government digital capabilities through ideations,
hackathons, and AI upskilling initiatives. However, these efforts would
not have been possible without the strong support of our stakeholders.</p>
<p>13. I would like to commend the participating agencies for being willing
to send their officers to these programmes and competition. It is a significant
commitment, given the day-to-day demands of our work, but it is a critical
investment to enable our officers to develop the most up-to-date AI skills.</p>
<p>14. I would particularly like to call out the nine agencies which have
partnered GovTech to expand Prompt Royale to their agencies through Prompt
Royale X, namely HDB, HSA, MCCY, MOE, MOM, MSF, MUIS, SCDF, and SFA. Through
Prompt Royale X, over 550 officers tackled prompt engineering challenges
tailored to their agencies’ specific needs. And that is a very long-term,
big picture outcome – not just that GovTech and MDDI develops these solutions
centrally, but that you are taking these approaches, these technologies
and these ideas back and applying them to the problems that you face; such
as analysing blood donation trends for HSA and streamlining Parent’s Gateway
Letter generation for MOE. All of these are agency specific, domain specific,
and it is your ability to take these ideas, learn from colleagues in the
room that come and participate, that enable the outcomes for your agencies,
for your ministry, for your colleagues.</p>
<p>15. Similarly, I would like to extend my appreciation to our industry
partners AWS, Databricks, Microsoft, Outsystems and Snowflake, for their
invaluable support for the LAUNCH! programme. Their partnership has been
critical to transform great ideas into impactful solutions for the public
sector.</p>
<p>16. To conclude, I would like to thank everyone involved in Innovation
Day for your commitment and for embodying the National AI vision of a trusted,
impactful, AI-enabled public service. This journey is just the beginning,
and I am excited to see how each of you continues to lead in AI, driving
innovation for a better public service and a better Singapore.</p>
