<li>
<p>Ladies and Gentlemen, a very good morning. It is my pleasure to be here
with all of you today.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Digital Sustainability is a critical issue that affects all of us. In
this digital age, the demand for compute power has surged; it’s driven
by technologies such as generative AI, the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud
computing, and who knows what’s going to be the next big thing. But we
can generally bet that bandwidth, connectivity and cybersecurity, these
are key things that are going to require the compute capabilities.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But there is a need to balance the economic and social benefits of digital
applications with the environmental effects that result from the emissions.
Digital Sustainability affects us all, and we need to address it holistically,
requiring us to take an ecosystem view, and working across in partnership
with different players in the system. Let me start by looking at our digital
connectivity infrastructure.</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Digital Connectivity Infrastructure</em>
</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the connectivity infrastructure front, much of Singapore’s Digital
Economy’s growth is underpinned by data centres. They house the compute
power, they process our digital activities and support every industry.
We know that our ICT sector accounts for about 17% of our GDP. We know
that DCs are collectively our biggest indirect carbon emitter. They contribute
to 82% of Singapore’s Information &amp; Communications (I&amp;C) sector
emissions, and 7% of Singapore’s total electricity consumption.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As the demand for digital and AI compute continues to rise, the need for
DC capacity will grow. At the same time, we need to ensure that Singapore
remains on track for our peak CO2 emissions by 2030, and net-zero by 2050.
These are our international climate commitments. We have every intention
of standing by the Paris Agreement. So, we need to find a way to turn strengths
into opportunity. This requires growth through sustainability, and turning
constraints into opportunity. As Singaporeans would know, there is a song
that goes “We have done it before, we will do it again.”</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The challenge of sustainable growth is not unique to Singapore, but we
are well placed, perhaps uniquely placed, to deliver innovative solutions
that could help the region and the rest of the world. We come from a position
of strength, as a regional DC hub. Industry and government here share a
strong commitment to stay at the forefront of DC sustainability. We introduced
the world’s first Tropical DC standard at ATx Enterprise last year, which
guides DCs to increase their operating temperatures in tropical climates
like Singapore’s, thus reducing their power needs for cooling. We are unlikely
a country to be a regional DC hub, but we stepped outside of our comfort
here. The temperature and humidity do not suggest that we should naturally
be a DC, but yet we are. We have to find ways to make sure those DCs are
increasingly operating at higher temperatures and reducing manpower. This
process complements existing DC sustainability certifications and standards
like the Green Mark for DCs that were developed in partnership with industry
stakeholders, such as many of you seated here today.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Additionally, we have enabled the continued growth of new and leading
DCs in Singapore such as through initiatives like the pilot Call-For Application
(CFA) in 2022, which facilitated the sustainable building of new DC capacity.
Through all of these processes, from the various understandings over the
last few years, we have seen innovation in this space. We have seen the
use of the best-in-class technologies, operating models, and new entrants
into the space. These have raised the bar, for best-in-class energy-efficient
facilities, and the adoption of energy-efficient equipment.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Last year, we launched the Digital Connectivity Blueprint (DCB), and this
put out our intention to chart a path for the continued growth for green
DCs in Singapore and push the digital sustainability envelope even further.
This would ensure that DCs continue to support our digital economy ambitions
and meet our global climate commitments.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Green DC roadmap, just announced by DPM Heng earlier this morning,
charts out the key pathways for that continued growth. The roadmap, published
by the Infocommunications Media Development Authority (IMDA), outlines
this holistic approach where they take an ecosystem view and highlights
our commitment to partner industry to build a dynamic DC sector, which
continues to serve the rest of the world, and be at the leading edge of
sustainability.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The DCs are key catalysts for partnerships across the ecosystem, to deliver
efficiency improvements and green energy solutions. Through the roadmap,
we seek to pioneer innovative solutions by facilitating such partnerships.
The roadmap is not only about using existing tools and technologies. We
do know how to use the best-in-class that we already know about today.
We want to put in place a process to develop further innovations, further
experimentation, to then realise the possibilities of increasing the capacity.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The roadmap provides for at least 300 megawatts of additional capacity
in the near term, and potentially another 200 megawatts and more through
green energy deployments. Through the additional capacity, we aim to seed
innovative ways to accelerate green energy efficiency, and to grow more
capacity through using green energy. There are a couple of key thrusts
that we are going to put in place to do this:</p>
<p>a. First, we want to enhance efficiency. We have to do so at both the
hardware as well as the software. We have to put in place best-in-class
technologies to maximise energy efficiency and capacity, energy-efficient
IT equipment and encourage green software techniques.</p>
<p>b. Second, we have to facilitate the DCs to accelerate their use of green
energy. So efficiency, one big thrust, and then the use of green energy.
Deploying increasing proportion of green energy at scale to maximise opportunities
for continued growth.</p>
<p>c. And that’s why I phrased it with “potentially another 200 megawatts
and more through green energy deployments.” Because if we are successful
at that delta, being thoroughly green, there’s no reason that we should
then automatically limit ourselves. The process of developing that extra
200 megawatts is what we’re planning for the next bound of ambition.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To encourage the DCs to become energy efficient, the government will provide
support to the industry.</p>
<p>a. DCs looking to improve their facility level efficiency can tap on schemes
such as EDB’s Resource Efficiency Grant for Emissions (REG€) and the Investment
Allowance for Emissions Reduction.</p>
<p>b. Enterprise users will be incentivised to switch to energy-efficient
IT equipment, through ESG’s Energy Efficiency Grant, and this will be expanded
to include the DC sector.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The roadmap sets out low-carbon energy sources that DCs can explore, which
include bioenergy, fuel cells with carbon capture, low-carbon hydrogen
and ammonia for a start. We welcome proposals from the industry to push
boundaries in realising these pathways in Singapore.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Much has been said about energy, and we should also focus on the efficient
use of other resources, such as water, which is increasingly becoming important
as rack densities rise. In 2021, the median Water Usage Effectiveness (WUE)
of DCs that were large was 2.2 cubic meters per megawatt hour. Moving forward,
IMDA will work with PUB to help DCs improve their WUE to 2.0 cubic meters
or less over the medium term.</p>
<p><em>Importance of Software</em>
</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improving DC efficiency is not just about improving energy efficiency
at the hardware level. It is also about greening software – including software
deployed within our DCs. We have been working to lower the carbon emissions
of software applications.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Jan 2024, we announced the launch of two key programmes targeted at
lowering carbon emissions of software applications, promoting sustainable
practices and the efficient use of computing resources.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We committed $30 million to drive research in optimising software design
and functions for green energy efficiency through the Green Computing Fund
Initiative (GCFI), enabling our local Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs)
to collaborate with the industry to solve problems relating to green computing,
where they focus on problems that are currently unmet by commercial solutions,
such as carbon-aware data computation and leveraging hardware improvements
for co-optimisation of hardware and software.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We also invited digital application users to participate in green software
trials to test the effectiveness of carbon reduction techniques for software
development. These trials will generate valuable data and insights for
IMDA to create green software guidelines for the industry.</p>
<p></p>
<p>a. We thank all our partners who are working together with IMDA for the
trials. The entire process that I’ve described - whether it’s about what
we’re doing with hardware, our standards, trust marks, how we target our
incentives, and now software - all of this is possible because industry
has been willing to partner with us, to experiment with us and co-develop
our way forward. Why am I saying this? Because I’m making a pitch. The
trials are still open, so if you’re attending here today, and you haven’t
participated in a trial, I have a QR code to invite you to join us in shaping
the future of digital sustainability. We have to do this together.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Digital Sustainability is a shared responsibility. We deeply value our
collaborations with international partners in co-creating best practices
for green software and digital solutions for the industry to adopt.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 2023, Singapore was the first government to join the Green Software
Foundation.</p>
<p></p>
<p>a. We joined the foundation with the aim of promoting green practices,
and to reach a mutual consensus on methods to effectively measure the environmental
impact of our software solutions. And we understood that this was not something
that we could say, well, the industry does it, the Foundation does it.
We as a government still have a role to play. We do hardware procurement,
we design our own software, in fact we operate our own applications. We
have to take some responsibility and we committed to joining the Green
Software Foundation.</p>
<p></p>
<p>b. Just last month (April 2024), the Green Software Foundation achieved
the ISO Standard status for its Software Carbon Intensity (SCI) specification.
It’s a significant milestone, because companies now have access to a standardised
methodology to calculate the rate of carbon emissions for their software.
The history of developing the space, whether it was flurocarbons or tailpipe
emissions, it starts with the issue of what is it you measure? How do you
come to some agreement across the industry? It is not necessarily as headline
grabbing as perhaps several million dollars worth of incentives and grants,
but it is an extremely important step to be able to decide on a standard,
and have people measure themselves up against best practices. It ultimately
enables more environmentally sustainable practices within the technology
sector.</p>
<p></p>
<p>i. I would like to take the opportunity to congratulate Sanjay Podder,
Chair of the Green Software Foundation, for this achievement. Well done,
Mr Sanjay.</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Building Collective Capabilities</em>
</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is important for governments to build our collective capabilities,
to share knowledge and our best practices with one another. IMDA’s digital
sustainability efforts were featured in a newly released report by the
Tony Blair Institute for Global Change. The report, one of the first of
its kind, examines digital sustainability across the AI value chain, and
highlights Singapore as a key case study in pioneering efforts to advance
the agenda in green AI practices. We thank them for the recognition but
we engaged in this work precisely for the opportunity to experiment, to
learn from the best around the world, and hopefully to see some of those
best practices employed.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’ve talked a lot about what the government is doing, what industry is
doing, and I’ve talked a lot about the balance between sustainability and
the economic opportunities. But the technologies that we’re trying to develop,
it’s not only about the business opportunities, it’s not only about the
economic opportunities. Here in Singapore, we are hoping to drive and consistently
shape the idea that AI and these technologies can and must be used for
the Public Good. I want to highlight that this approach is starting to
bear fruit.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We have a health technology agency called Synapxe, and we have a whole
series of healthcare tech providers.</p>
<p>a. Synapxe has a newly launched platform called HEALIX. It’s the first
comprehensive cloud-based analytics platform for our entire public healthcare
sector. If you know the way health technology works, healthcare sector
works, you have multiple players with multiple layers, academic institutions,
and technology. Given the privacy concerns and security concerns associated
with health data, it’s a big cost of the compliance work.</p>
<p>b. But using the technologies that are available today, in a way that
perhaps you wouldn’t have imagined only a couple of years ago, we can now
deploy at a scale across the entire public healthcare sector, cloud-based
analytics platform, cloud-native tools, and rapidly bringing AI-based tools
to bear on patient care. AI bringing together public healthcare sector’s
data on a single platform, opening up collaborative possibilities, data
driven insights and the use of AI. Making that idea of AI for the Public
Good real, not in some future imagined possibility but today, deploying
and driving AI. But AI for the Public Good, just like all the other things
that we talked about, will require multi-stapling. This type of thing was
only possible because we’ve had that close collaboration between our health
tech agency, finance, the industry players like AWS, and all of our healthcare
providers and academic institutions who contribute useful data.</p>
<p>c. Every single example that we have out there, which demonstrates these
values or principles, is going to require this type of close collaboration.
I look forward to many more such examples in the near to medium term, and
to do so, we will continue to work hand in glove with the industry to build
and implement solutions to enhance digital sustainability. Everybody here
who’s not already signed up for a trial, co-created substandard, contributed
to one of our reports – we have many QR codes.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you very much for inviting me to join you today at The Digital Sustainability
Forum. I hope that what we do today will catalyse ideas, drive constructive
discussions, and help shape Singapore’s sustainable digital future. Thank
you all very much.</p>
