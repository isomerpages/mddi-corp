<p><strong>OPENING REMARKS BY MINISTER OF STATE RAHAYU MAHZAM AT SAFER WITH GOOGLE (15 AUGUST 2024)</strong>
</p>
<p>1. Good morning, everyone. I am glad to be able to join you at this year’s
Safer with Google event. This is the second iteration of Safer with Google,
and also the second year that the Ministry has participated in, and supported
the event. Earlier this morning, I visited the Sandbox Experiences, and
was heartened to see the various booths which showed developments and efforts
to create a Safer Home, Community and Ecosystem. It was so lovely that
it was fashioned after our local spaces like the kitchen and living room.
I am also looking forward to hearing from the other speakers, Ben, Karen
and Laurie, and speaking to some of the YouTube Creators later.</p>
<p>2. You may be aware that recently, my Ministry changed our name from the
Ministry of Communications and Information to the Ministry of Digital Development
and Information. The name change emphasises our role in spearheading Singapore’s
digital agenda, to help transform our economy and also improve our lives.</p>
<p>3. However, even as we integrate digital technologies into our daily lives,
reaping many benefits along the way, we have to recognise the risks present
in this increasingly digital age. The online space, while full of opportunities,
is also a domain where bad actors, like scammers, lurk.</p>
<p>4. Technology can help us to mitigate some of the online risks, but it
can only do so much. Ultimately, every individual must play their part
in protecting themselves. Achieving this requires scaling up public education,
building a trusted mobile ecosystem, and strengthening enforcement.</p>
<p>5. Collaboration between the government, industry and civil society will
be critical in these efforts. Together, we must do more in three areas:</p>
<p>a. Promoting digital literacy,</p>
<p>b. Building cyber resilience and fostering trust in the mobile ecosystem,
and</p>
<p>c. Combating bad actors together, with technology.</p>
<p>6. Let me cover these areas in turn.</p>
<p><strong><u>Promoting Digital Literacy</u></strong>
</p>
<p>7. First, we must continue to better equip individuals to confidently
navigate the online space. In that aspect, I want to thank Google for being
a strong supporter of the Digital for Life (DfL) movement since it was
launched in 2021. The DfL movement represents our 3P – Public, Private
and People – sectors coming together to help Singaporeans reap the benefits
of digital in all aspects of life, and demonstrates our commitment to cross-sector
collaboration in promoting digital literacy.</p>
<p>8. On top of this, I understand that Google has taken further steps to
invest in developing more Trust &amp; Safety practitioners. This would
help build a larger pool of individuals with deeper expertise and who are
better able to safeguard our citizens’ journeys in the digital domain.</p>
<p>9. On our end, the Government will continue to ramp up public education
efforts to equip citizens to go online safely. Earlier this year, the Infocomm
Media Development Authority (IMDA) launched a Digital Skills for Life framework
that sets out five baseline digital competencies to help Singaporeans strengthen
their daily digital literacy skills, including how to be safe, smart and
kind online. Since the launch, more than 50,000 seniors and pre-seniors
have been taught these digital skills. Moving forward, IMDA will continue
to roll out bite-sized materials to support parents in guiding their children’s
online use on IMDA’s DfL portal, which covers topics such as managing screen
use and cyberbullying.</p>
<p><strong><u>Building cyber resilience and fostering trust in the mobile ecosystem</u></strong>
</p>
<p>10. Second, even as we ramp up public education efforts, our efforts may
lag behind the evolving tactics of cybercriminals. To minimise the occurrence
of online harms, it is critical that we build a trusted mobile ecosystem
in tandem with education efforts.</p>
<p>11. IMDA’s 2023 Singapore Digital Society Report shows that the vast majority
of Singaporeans own smart phones, including 89% of seniors above the age
of 60. Further, 96% of those above 15, and 99% of those above 60 are afraid
of falling victim to scams. Clearly, many are concerned about these harms
that could befall them as they use their devices.</p>
<p>12. Public-private sector partnerships allow us to develop innovative
solutions to tackle online harms, such as scams. Scams target the vulnerable,
and have evolved rapidly, with many novel methods being developed and employed
by perpetrators. In 2022, the Singapore Police Force set up the Anti-Scam
Command, to consolidate expertise and resources to combat scams. In July
2023, the new Online Criminal Harms Act came into effect, which allow authorities
to order the swift blocking of online accounts or content suspected to
be used for crimes, including scams. In January this year, the Cyber Security
Agency of Singapore (CSA) published the Safe App Standard that provides
a common benchmark and guidance to local app developers on necessary security
controls and best practices to protect their users against common malware
and phishing attempts.</p>
<p>13. The importance of building up preventive measures against scams and
fraud cannot be understated, and we see the fight against scams as one
of our top priorities.</p>
<p>14. We have been working closely with Google to protect users from apps
that attempt to deceive users by masquerading as an official government
app. When searching for official government apps, users on Android will
now see a “Government” badge to assure them that they are installing an
authentic government app. This is a useful feature that engenders trust
and tackles government app impersonation attempts.</p>
<p>15. On top of this, we have also partnered with Google to minimise the
ways in which scammers can take advantage of vulnerable users. CSA and
Google have jointly developed a new enhanced fraud protection (EFP) security
feature for Android users through Google Play Protect, which will block
the download of high-risk applications that meet a set of criteria, such
as apps downloaded from suspicious sources, apps that request for sensitive
information, and apps that are from an unknown developer.</p>
<p>16. This is a significant achievement, as it is the first time that the
private and public sectors have come together to develop an anti-scam product.
I am also happy to share that Singapore is the first country with 100%
rollout of this feature.</p>
<p>17. However, even with this feature there have been close to 900,000 attempts
to sideload high-risk apps. The Government and our partners have put in
place a number of initiatives to combat scams which have been effective
in reducing the number of malware-enabled scams to 35 cases in the second
quarter of 2024, down from 60 cases in the first quarter of 2024. Nonetheless,
users need to play their part to protect themselves too.</p>
<p>18. We encourage other tech industry players to similarly step forward
and partner with the Government to develop innovative solutions to combat
scams.</p>
<p><strong><u>Fighting bad actors together, and with technology</u></strong>
</p>
<p>19. It is with this spirit of partnership that we work closely with the
private sector on co-creating regulations to enhance online safety.</p>
<p>20. In 2022, we amended the Broadcasting Act, to introduce new regulations
to minimise the reach of harmful content, such as content that advocates
suicide, self-harm or physical and sexual violence.</p>
<p>21. In July last year, we introduced the Code of Practice for Online Safety,
which requires Designated Social Media Services (DSMSs) to have systems
and processes in place to prevent Singapore users, particularly children,
from accessing harmful online content. The Code of Practice also requires
DSMSs, including YouTube, to submit annual reports to the IMDA, and we
look forward to seeing the results, which will be made available publicly
later this year.</p>
<p>22. Despite the steps that we have taken thus far, online safety remains
a work in progress. MDDI’s 2024 Online Safety Poll, which polls respondents
aged 15 and above, found that 74% of respondents have encountered harmful
content online – a 9% increase from 2023. And among those who reported
harmful content to the platforms, 8 in 10 experienced issues with the reporting
process. We think that more must be done to reduce harmful online content,
and to make the reporting process easier and more effective.</p>
<p>23. This is why our efforts cannot stop here. In line with the Government’s
accretive and collaborative approach to regulating the digital domain,
we have been working closely with our industry partners, including Google,
to develop a Code of Practice for Online Safety for App Distribution Services
(ADSs), commonly known as app stores. ADSs serve as a gateway to most content
on mobile devices, including online games. This Code will require ADSs
to put in place systems and processes to deal with harmful content within
apps.</p>
<p>24. A key feature of the Code would be the additional requirements to
protect children online. One way in which we are thinking of doing so is
through the introduction of age assurance measures. This could be undertaken
through age verification, by way of verifying identity documentation, or
age estimation, where technology is used to gauge a user’s age. While the
work on the ADS Code is ongoing, we are grateful for Google’s continued
participation in the development of the Code.</p>
<p>25. Besides developing more holistic and robust regulations to enhance
the safety of users, technology remains a critical lever in the fight against
bad actors. At the first Online Trust &amp; Safety Forum in May this year,
we launched the Centre for Advanced Technologies in Online Safety (CATOS).
CATOS aims to develop cutting-edge technologies that prevent, detect, and
mitigate online harms, and will serve as a platform for constructive partnerships
with industry. We look forward to the technological developments by CATOS
to stay ahead of the evolving challenges in the online space.</p>
<p>26. To close, enhancing online safety and cultivating a digitally savvy
citizenry is an immense task in this complex online landscape. I am glad
to see the continued collaboration between our agencies and communities
towards achieving this shared goal. Let us continue to use technology to
create opportunities, so that more people can feel confident to safely
learn, explore and create content online.</p>
<p>27. Thank you.</p>
