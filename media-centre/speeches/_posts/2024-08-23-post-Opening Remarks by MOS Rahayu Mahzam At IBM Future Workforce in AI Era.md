<p><strong>Opening Remarks by Ms Rahayu Mahzam, Minister of State for Digital Development and Information, At IBM Future Workforce in AI Era (23 August 2024)</strong>
</p>
<p>Justina Nixon - Saintil, Vice President for Corporate Social Responsibility
and Chief Impact Officer, IBM Global</p>
<p>Yean Feng Yue, Corporate Social Responsibility Leader, IBM APAC</p>
<p>Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,</p>
<p>Good morning</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>I am glad to join all of you here this morning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Today’s theme, “Future Workforce in the AI Era”, is an especially pertinent
one given how AI is rapidly becoming an integral part of various industries,
from education to law.</p>
<p>a. Workers are increasingly leveraging AI tools to automate routine tasks,
save time and boost productivity. In fact, LinkedIn reported an increase
in the number of job postings with “ChatGPT expertise” listed in their
requirements, demonstrating the growing importance of these tools in today’s
professional landscape.</p>
<p>b. A relatively recent study conducted by your company on generative AI
also showed that 43% of the respondents, mostly CEOs of MNCs from more
than 30 countries and 26 industries, are already using AI to make strategic
business decisions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the same time, we are also seeing the increasing uncertainty and anxiety
about job displacement and skill obsolescence due to AI.</p>
<p>a. Earlier this year, the popular language learning app Duolingo made
the decision to offboard 10 percent of its contractors as it was pivoting
to using AI to translate content.</p>
<p>b. Buy now, pay later service provider Klarna has also been open about
reducing its workforce and replacing them with AI.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These examples show that companies are increasingly turning to AI for
their operational needs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The concerns faced by workers are therefore real, and if left unaddressed,
could escalate into widespread discontent.</p>
<p>a. Just three weeks ago, more than 300 video game performers and Hollywood
actors picketed in front of the Warner Bros Studios building in Burbank,
California, to protest against what they call an unwillingness from top
gaming companies to protect workers against the unregulated use of AI.
This was in addition to the Hollywood writers’ strike that took place last
year.</p>
<p>b. In April this year, hundreds of nurses gathered outside a hospital
in Oakland, California, to protest the use of AI replacing certain nursing
duties.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As with any new technology, we will need to grapple with how it could
be used to benefit our people and society, and not cause harm. Let me share
how the Government is thinking about this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It remains our belief that AI has the potential to help workers and enterprises
increase their productivity and stay relevant, provided they have the capabilities
to apply it well. In fact, companies are reporting that they expect AI
to have a positive impact on their businesses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But the benefits of AI extend far beyond just employers. We are seeing
how AI is transforming our workforce by enhancing their ability to analyze
data more effectively, automating mundane and repetitive tasks, and freeing
up time for higher value work. As a result, employees are becoming more
productive and engaged in meaningful tasks, and better equipped to contribute
to their organisations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These benefits are too significant to ignore, and the advancement of AI
is something we cannot, and should not, resist. Our responsibility lies
then in preparing our workforce to succeed in this new era.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many thoughtful observers have pointed out that it is not so much AI displacing
workers, but AI-proficient workers displacing AI-deficient ones.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This means that we should strive to equip our workers with the necessary
skillsets to utilise AI tools, so that they can increase their productivity,
avoid untimely disruptions to their jobs, and help enterprises optimise
their operations and improve their competitiveness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How then are we doing so?</p>
<p>a. For those already in the workforce, we have developed the Job Transformation
Maps (JTMs) for various sectors to help guide skills development and job
redesign among employers, workers, and training providers.</p>
<p>i. For example, training partners under the Information and Communications
JTM offer about 200 AI-related courses. As of Dec 2023, they have trained
about 18,000 people to be confident users of AI.</p>
<p>b. For those looking to pursue a career as an AI practitioner, which includes
roles such as AI Engineer, Machine Learning Engineer, or Data Scientist,
we also have numerous Company-Led Training programmes that support companies
to hire and train those with the pre-requisite skillsets to develop a career
in AI.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Beyond our workers, it is also essential that we democratise access to
the skills needed to thrive in this new era. We need to broaden AI education
to ensure that all segments of society, regardless of background, are empowered
to participate in the AI-driven workforce.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By equipping more people with AI skills, we can drive economic growth
and reduce inequality, ensuring that the benefits for AI are shared across
society. It would also allow us to tap into diverse perspectives, ensuring
that AI technologies are developed with the needs and values of all communities
in mind.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This means <strong>taking a proactive approach by going upstream to prepare our youths even before they enter the workforce. </strong>It
includes<strong> integrating AI education and digital literacy into vocational training and equipping them with the foundational skills required to do well in a rapidly changing job market.</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Additionally, we must <strong>ensure inclusivity in our approach </strong>by
creating pathways that are accessible to all.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But the Government certainly cannot do all these alone. It is essential
that companies step up to partner with us on this endeavour, and I am glad
that many have done so.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To this end, I am heartened to note that IBM will be collaborating with
Singapore Polytechnic, Republic Polytechnic, and Junior Achievement to
provide free AI training for both youth and adult learners in Singapore.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Through IBM’s SkillsBuild coursework, this collaboration aims to equip
4,500 Singaporeans with new digital skills, including AI. The SkillsBuild
programme features an online platform that is complemented by customized
practical learning experiences delivered in collaboration with a global
network of partners.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The initiative seeks to help bridge the global skills gap, by helping
learners develop valuable new skills that are in demand and access new
career opportunities.</p>
<p>a. Both Singapore Poly and Republic Poly will incorporate the SkillsBuild
programme into their curriculum where students will have access to topics
like cybersecurity and data science, in addition to AI.</p>
<p>b. IBM is also collaborating with Junior Achievement, a non-profit organisation
dedicated to inspiring and preparing people to succeed in a global economy.
This collaboration aims to prepare and empower the youths in Singapore
through providing essential IT- related curriculum to 14- to 18-year-old
learners, as well as to support women returning to the workplace, which
includes single mothers. The initiative will also be open to domestic workers
in Singapore who are interested to learn basic AI skills.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In conclusion, the path forward is clear – we cannot and should not resist
the progress of AI. Instead, we must harness its potential in ways that
are inclusive and equitable. This means ensuring that our workers, from
all segments of society, have the opportunity to acquire the skills needed
to thrive in this new age.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The future of the workforce in the age of AI is a future of possibilities
– if we are willing to embrace it, invest in our people, and foster partnerships
that bridge the gap between technology and humanity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By doing so, we can build a future where innovation and inclusivity go
hand-in-hand, creating a world where everyone has the opportunity to thrive.</p>
</li>

<p>Thank you.</p>
