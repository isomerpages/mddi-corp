<p><strong>"Strengthening Partnerships For The Digital Economy 2.0"</strong>
</p>
<p>Mr Deepak Singh, Vice President, Next Generation Developer Experience,
Amazon Web Services,</p>
<p>Priscilla Chong, Country Manager, AWS Singapore,</p>
<p>Elsie Tan, Worldwide Public Sector Country Manager, AWS Singapore,</p>
<p>Ladies and Gentlemen,</p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong>
</p>
<p>1. Good morning and thank you for the warm welcome. I am happy to be here
at the 10th edition of the AWS Summit Singapore. Congratulations on your
5000-day milestone, which Priscilla shared in her opening address.</p>
<p>2. AWS and Singapore have built a strong partnership over the years.</p>
<p>a. AWS launched its first Asia Pacific Singapore Region in 2010. At that
time, it was AWS’s first expansion outside of the US and Europe.</p>
<p>b. Since then, AWS has invested over S$11 billion in Singapore, building
up its cloud infrastructure and ecosystem to support customers in Singapore
and the region.</p>
<p>c. Today, Amazon hires more than 2,000 workers across its business units
in Singapore including its cloud services, operations, logistics, and data
engineering teams. These employees, a majority who are Singaporeans and
PRs, are taking on exciting jobs at the frontier of technology and helping
to drive technology development and business transformation across the
region and beyond.</p>
<p>3. Partnerships with companies like AWS have contributed to the growth
of our digital economy.</p>
<p>a. Singapore’s digital economy generated S$106 billion dollars’ worth
of value-add to the economy, which accounted for about 17% of our nominal
GDP in 2022.</p>
<p>b. Overall, the digital economy grew at a compound annual growth rate
(CAGR) of about 12.9% p.a. since 2017, outpacing the overall economy.</p>
<p>4. The vibrant digital economy has also generated good job opportunities
for Singapore.</p>
<p>a. Today, we have about 210,000 tech professionals, a 4.7% increase over
the last five years.</p>
<p>b. About 7 in 10 of tech professionals are locals.</p>
<p>c. Within the tech sector, there are also about 7,000 job vacancies according
to an MOM survey.</p>
<p><strong>Positive Outlook for the Digital Economy</strong>
</p>
<p>5. The outlook for the digital economy remains positive.</p>
<p>a. We see continued strong momentum on digitalisation across industry
sectors and across the region, not just larger enterprises but also SMEs.</p>
<p>i. For example, the technology adoption rate amongst SMEs in Singapore
increased from 73.8% in 2018 to 94.3% in 2022.</p>
<p>ii. SMEs in the region are also estimated to deploy an additional US$130
billion to digitalise their business activities over the next three years.</p>
<p>b. These examples point to the further growth of our digital economy in
the region, including Singapore.</p>
<p><strong>Digital Economy 2.0</strong>
</p>
<p>6. The Government is building on this strong Digital Economy foundation.</p>
<p>a. We had launched the Digital Connectivity Blueprint and refreshed the
National AI Strategy last year, and will soon release the Digital Enterprise
Blueprint (DEB) later this month.</p>
<p>b. These efforts chart our approach to position Singapore to ride the
next wave of digitalisation and take the Digital Economy from 1.0 to 2.0.</p>
<p>7. The Digital Economy Blueprint focuses on empowering enterprises, especially
the SMEs. Broadly, we will do so through 3 thrusts:</p>
<p>a. First, we will empower enterprises to <strong>Be Smarter </strong>through
using AI-powered digital solutions. We will help enterprises and workers
access the benefits from AI through <strong>IMDA’s SMEs Go Digital programme</strong>,
which curates a list of pre-approved digital solutions suitable for broad
based adoption, which will see more solutions that are AI-enabled. For
enterprises who want to do more, we are also supporting them through our
Advanced Digital Solutions scheme, which helps bring together the tech
ecosystem to curate solutions for key problems identified by sector leads.</p>
<p>b. Second, we will support our enterprises to <strong>Scale Faster</strong> through
the adoption of integrated digital solutions. This is because SMEs have
shared that they were constrained by the lack of interoperability and scalability
of their digital solutions. We will therefore step up our effort to (a)
include more integrated digital solutions under the SMEs Go Digital programme,
(b) stipulate inter-operability requirements where possible for these solutions,
and (c) encourage more of these solutions to be cloud native for greater
scalability.</p>
<p>c. Third, we will also equip enterprises to <strong>Be Safer</strong> by
improving their cyber resilience. We will support SMEs in taking steps
to improve their cyber hygiene by launching a cybersecurity health check
tool for enterprises to assess their cyber hygiene, benchmark themselves
against their industry peers and access resources for them to plug the
gaps.</p>
<p>d. We will also go upstream and raise the cybersecurity standards of the
digital systems used by our enterprises, and work with sector-leads to
develop industry- specific guidelines for cybersecurity.</p>
<p>8. We will share more details at the launch event for the DEB, which will
take place at the end of the month.</p>
<p><strong>Strengthening Partnerships for Digital Economy 2.0</strong>
</p>
<p>9. Cloud service providers like AWS play an important role in growing
the digital economy ecosystem. Besides being a foundational digital infrastructure
for organisations, cloud service providers enable enterprises to easily
access digital resources like compute and storage, as well as advanced
capabilities like AI.</p>
<p>10. Therefore, I welcome AWS’s commitment to strengthen its partnership
with Singapore by investing an <strong>additional S$12 billion here by 2028</strong>.</p>
<p>11. Besides growing its cloud infrastructure and services in Singapore,
AWS will also contribute to the vibrancy of the broader cloud services
ecosystem, especially in getting more organisations to adopt cloud services
and AI capabilities.</p>
<p>12. <strong>As part of this effort, I am glad to announce the launch of the AWS AI Spring Singapore programme! </strong>This
will be a multifaceted collaboration between AWS, the public sector, and
private sector enterprises.</p>
<p>13. There are six strategic pillars in this comprehensive AI programme
that aims to accelerate the adoption of AI by public sector agencies and
enterprises.</p>
<p>a. For example, in partnership with IMDA, AWS will make available their
products like Amazon Bedrock, Amazon SageMaker, and Amazon Q to local enterprises.</p>
<p>b. These products would allow enterprises to more easily develop AI solutions
for their business problems.</p>
<p>i. For example, Amazon Bedrock allows developers to easily incorporate
generative AI into their applications. By using one single API, developers
get access to foundation models from companies like Anthropic, Meta, and
StabilityAI, in addition to Amazon. Enterprises can then easily mix and
match these AI models to build generative AI applications based on their
use case.</p>
<p>ii. Another example is Amazon Sagemaker. This tool is designed for data
analyst, data scientists and AI engineers to tinker with AI models. They
can fine tune models to adapt and suit their enterprise needs and use it
to build a large language model operations to model the performance of
their models.</p>
<p>c. AWS will also collaborate with IMDA to help local enterprises leverage
GenAI. Under IMDA’s GenAI x Digital Leaders Programme, this new collaboration
with AWS will help enterprises identify business use-cases, navigate technical
complexities, and deploy their own customised GenAI digital solutions.
The GenAI x Digital Leaders initiative is for larger and more digitally
mature enterprises looking to develop and deploy their own GenAI digital
solutions suited for their business needs with the support of tech vendors
and technology giants.</p>
<p>14. So there is a programme for all enterprises, across different sectors
and different sized companies at different stages of digital maturity.
Just come aboard and take the first step to transform yourselves and harness
the opportunities with cloud and GenAI.</p>
<p>15. These offerings will greatly enable our enterprises to develop solutions
to improve business efficiency, streamline costs, and deliver more intuitive
and personalised solutions for their customers.</p>
<p>16. <strong>AWS will also commit to build the tech workforce capabilities to develop and deploy AI-enabled digital solutions.</strong>
</p>
<p>a. AWS’ AI Spring Workforce pillar will see AWS collaborating with ITE
and Polytechnics to incorporate AI into their curriculum. This will help
build industry-relevant competencies for students. This is in line with
AWS' contribution to IMDA’s TechSkills Accelerator (TeSA) for ITE and Polytechnics
Alliance (TIP Alliance), which aims to strengthen ITE and Polytechnic graduates’
employment outcomes in tech and provide pathways for them throughout their
careers.</p>
<p>b. This is an important commitment. Not just because you are creating
good opportunities for ITE and Polytechnic graduates, but also an important
shift in Singapore on how we want to acknowledge and recognise skills,
and a broader definition of meritocracy.</p>
<p>c. The curriculum will include content from AWS Academy which covers AI
modules like “Machine Learning Foundations”, and “Machine Learning for
Natural Language Processing”, in addition to their Cloud modules like “Cloud
Foundations”, “Cloud Development”.</p>
<p>d. Besides curriculum, AWS will also facilitate hands-on learning by supporting
the development of AI Labs, and offering their gamified teaching assets
like AWS DeepRacer and League of Large Language models, which introduce
a fun way of acquiring skills in AI and Machine Learning.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>
</p>
<p>17. In closing, I would like to wish AWS success in your investments here,
and for your commitment to advancing our digital economy, especially in
AI. Together, we will continue to push the boundaries of what is possible,
ensuring that Singapore remains a global hub for technology and innovation.</p>
<p>18. Thank you.</p>
