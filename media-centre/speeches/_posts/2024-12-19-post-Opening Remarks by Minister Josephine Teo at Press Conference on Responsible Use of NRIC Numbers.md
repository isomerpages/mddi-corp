<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Thank you to the members of the media for being here. I would firstly
like to acknowledge the concerns of the public, which we take very seriously.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We are very sorry to have caused them much anxiety. We have wanted to
give them better protection, and this requires a change in our policy involving
NRIC numbers because the current situation leaves us vulnerable. Let me
explain why.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In our daily interactions, we are identified by our names. However, our
names may not be unique. For example, for organisations dealing with many
people, say a hospital with several patients named Tan Ah Kow, they can
be confused and will each need a unique identifier, which is their NRIC
number.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So, when the hospital needs to perform an operation or dispense medication,
the doctor or nurse must make sure it is the right Tan Ah Kow, and they
will ask “what is your NRIC number?”.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because the main purpose of the NRIC number is to be a unique identifier,
it cannot be a secret, just as our names are not secret. We must assume
that our NRIC numbers are known to quite a few people.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, over time, NRIC numbers have increasingly come to be used as
more than just an identifier.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some organisations have started depending on a person producing his full
NRIC number as proof that the person is who he or she claims to be. He
or she is then granted access to privileged information or services. That
is, the NRIC number has also become an authenticator. This is not a good
idea. Since our NRIC numbers are known to some other people, someone unauthorised
may misuse our NRIC number to get access.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Partial (or masked) NRIC numbers are also frequently used. E.g. when we
visit a condominium, and the security guard takes down our particulars,
including our partial NRIC number. Many people think that this way, the
full NRIC number remains concealed. This creates a false sense of security,
because in fact from the partial number, you can make a good guess of what
the full NRIC number is using simple algorithms, especially if you also
know the person’s year of birth. This process is not at all difficult.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We therefore had to change the status quo, to move away from the NRIC
number as an authenticator, and from using masked NRIC numbers for that
false sense of security. We knew this had to be done over a period of time,
and that a major effort would be needed to help Singaporeans understand
the risks, because of our longstanding practices and habits. And it is
better to do this while the problem is relatively contained.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Within government, we started to do a few things: Get agencies to stop
using the NRIC number as a password or to prove someone is who he or she
claims to be. Discontinue the use of masked NRIC numbers, starting with
new services first, and then existing services as each service is updated.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unfortunately, there was a lapse in coordination between the staffs on
how this was to be implemented, and this led to ACRA’s unmasking of NRIC
numbers in the new Bizfile.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let me now ask Chief Executive of ACRA, Huey Min, to explain what happened<sup>1</sup>,
and Min Indranee will then set out the next steps from MOF’s perspective<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thereafter I will provide a further explanation on our larger plans regarding
NRIC practices<sup>3</sup>.</p>
