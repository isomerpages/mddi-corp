<p><strong><u>BUILDING A TRUSTED CYBERSPACE TOGETHER</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Fellow Ministers, distinguished guests</p>
<p>Colleagues and friends</p>
<p><strong><u>Introduction</u></strong>
</p>
<p>1. Let me first extend a warm welcome to all participants of the Singapore
International Cyber Week (SICW) 2024. Thank you for making time to be here,
especially our overseas guests. Your presence here speaks volumes about
the shared importance we place on addressing cybersecurity challenges.</p>
<p>2. We hope this event serves as a platform for the robust exchange of
perspectives and ideas on how to tackle the critical issues we all face
in securing our cyberspace. The theme for this year’s SICW is <strong>“Building Trust and Security in the Digital Era”</strong>.
It is particularly timely for me to speak about the topic. Two weeks ago,
our Prime Minister Lawrence Wong launched our refreshed Smart Nation Strategy.
Among other goals, he reaffirmed the importance of upholding trust in the
digital age.</p>
<p>3. Indeed, our citizens and enterprises must feel confident in the digital
infrastructure that they depend on in their daily lives. Our investors
must be able to trust that their operations and assets are secure in our
digital economy. Only by having a trusted Smart Nation can we maintain
public confidence in a shared digital future and continue to be an attractive
place to live and do business.</p>
<p>4. However, as we all know, building and maintaining trust is an ongoing
challenge. Bad actors of today are constantly innovating, developing new
methods to exploit vulnerabilities. Cyber issues have become more complicated.
We face increasing risks such as concentration risks involving third-party
vendors, cyber-espionage incidents, and ransomware attacks – all of which
occupy our collective attention.</p>
<p>5. In response, Singapore has taken the proactive approach of enhancing
our regulatory levers to improve the security and resilience of our digital
infrastructure.</p>
<p>a. Earlier this year, we updated the Cybersecurity Act to strengthen the
safeguards for our Critical Information Infrastructure (CII). We expanded
its regulatory ambit beyond essential services to include foundational
digital infrastructure – the “building blocks” of the digital world. Things
like data centres and cloud services, that power our digital economy and
the products and services that we use daily.</p>
<p>b. We are also looking to introduce a new Digital Infrastructure Act to
complement existing regulations and address a broader set of resilience
and security risks faced by digital infrastructure and service providers.
These range from technical misconfigurations to physical hazards such as
fires, and we must find ways to mitigate the likelihood and impact of systemic
disruptions.</p>
<p>6. But no nation can tackle these challenges in silos. Cyber threats are
borderless. Thus, international cooperation is essential in our efforts
to build a trusted cyberspace.</p>
<p>7. Cyber diplomacy is essential, especially during such fraught times.
And it cannot be limited to our friends and countries who think like us.
It is all the more important to include countries who have different world
views and who do not think like us. If we avoid difficult conversations,
we will most certainly <u>not</u> be able to avoid difficult consequences.</p>
<p>8. This explains why Singapore actively collaborates with other countries
on various digital trust and security issues, from cybercrime to cybersecurity
threats. We will do our part to contribute to a multilateral, rules-based
cyberspace we can trust, and our citizens can benefit from.</p>
<p>9. Singapore currently chairs the Five-Year UN Open-Ended Working Group
on Security of and in the use of ICTs (UN OEWG 2021 to 2025).</p>
<p>a. This serves as the only UN platform where all States, which includes
many of us here today, can come together to cooperate against existing
and emerging cyber threats, and support efforts to advance an open, secure,
and interoperable cyberspace.</p>
<p>b. Notwithstanding the geopolitical tensions and differences, I am pleased
that the OEWG had successfully adopted the third annual progress report
by consensus at the Eighth Substantive Session in July this year.</p>
<p>c. It highlights our collective commitment to advance multilateralism
in the cyberspace undergirded by rules, norms and principles of responsible
State behaviour.</p>
<p>10. In addition, Singapore is a member of the Counter-Ransomware Initiative
(CRI), a group that brings together 68 States and international organisations
to cooperate in countering the threat posed by ransomware criminals.</p>
<p>a. Several of our CRI partners such as Australia, Canada, Germany, Philippines,
the UK, Vietnam and INTERPOL, are here today.</p>
<p>b. As the co-chair of the Policy Pillar with the UK, Singapore is working
with members on policy measures to enhance the resilience of CRI members
and disrupt the ransomware business model.</p>
<p>c. Of note, at the 4th CRI Summit earlier this month, members, alongside
a group of cybersecurity insurers, jointly issued a “Guidance for Organisations
During Ransomware Incidents”, to help victim organisations to consider
the various steps to take and make informed decisions when facing a ransomware
incident.</p>
<p>11. Regionally, we have made progress to operationalise the ASEAN Regional
CERT. This initiative serves to enhance the timely sharing of information
as well as regional coordination, to address cybersecurity threats and
incidents.</p>
<p>a. In February 2024, at the ASEAN Digital Ministers Meeting which I chaired
in Singapore, ASEAN Member States agreed on the financial model for the
ASEAN Regional CERT.</p>
<p>b. We are heartened by the trust placed in us by our fellow ASEAN Member
States, for Singapore to fund and host the physical facility of the ASEAN
Regional CERT for up to 10 years.</p>
<p>c. We will be sharing more about the next steps for this important initiative
under the leadership of Malaysia, as our first rotating overall coordinator
with all partners.</p>
<p>12. Beyond governments, we are exploring ways to expand partnerships with
industry players to improve digital security outcomes.</p>
<p>a. At last year’s SICW, we announced the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding
between the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA) and Google, and this
partnership has borne fruit.</p>
<p>b. In February 2024, CSA and Google rolled out a new, co-developed Enhanced
Fraud Protection feature to protect Android users registered in Singapore
from apps that are likely to be malicious.</p>
<p>c. This feature is the first-of-its kind and has had promising results
in protecting our citizens. It has also generated much international interest,
with Thailand and Brazil exploring similar collaborations.</p>
<p><strong><u>Conclusion</u></strong>
</p>
<p>13. We welcome further cooperation with likeminded partners, as we continue
to navigate an increasingly complex cyberspace.</p>
<p>14. There is always more to be done to collectively strengthen trust and
security in our cyberspace. I believe that SICW is a platform for us to
start, or continue, conversations on how we can better share knowledge,
and collaborate to create a global cyberspace that we can all trust.</p>
<p>15. This evening, we look forward to hearing from my good friend Malaysian
Minister of Digital YB <strong>Gobind </strong>Singh Deo, who will share
more about Malaysia’s perspectives on how to build Trust and Security in
the Digital Era. I have no doubt that he will provide many useful insights.</p>
<p>16. Thank you and I wish you all a productive and engaging week in Singapore.</p>
