<p style="text-align: justify;">Rudra Chaudhuri, Director, Carnegie India&nbsp;<br>
Excellencies&nbsp;<br>
Ladies and Gentlemen</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Introduction</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1.<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>It is my great pleasure to address you at this Global Technology Summit.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
2.<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>Digital technology has transformed our lives and data is a critical resource that can generate significant value in the digital domain. Innovative applications of data can:&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>a.<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>Drive the digital economy;&nbsp;<br>
<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>b.<span style="white-space: pre;"> 	</span>Inform policy-making; and&nbsp;<br>
<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>c.<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>Improve the lived experience of our people.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
3.<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>Many have described data as the “new oil”.<br>
<br>
<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>a.<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>Like oil, data needs to be processed before it becomes useful, and requires good infrastructure to enable reliable access.&nbsp;<br>
<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>b.Yet in many ways, “oil” is a flawed analogy.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
4.<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>Unlike oil, the nature of data is that it is not finite and does not deplete. In fact, it is quite the opposite.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>a.<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>We can unlock new value by re-sharing and re-using the data. It can bring benefits to many organisations concurrently.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
5.<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>The free flow of data across borders enables our businesses to digitally serve many markets, creating efficiencies and driving innovation.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>a.<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>In fact, excessive restrictions on data sharing can be counterproductive.<br>
<br>
6.<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>At the same time, there are legitimate concerns about our personal data being mishandled or abused.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>a.<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>Data breaches and scams can have a devastating impact on their victims.&nbsp;<br>
<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>b.<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>Businesses’ reputation are at risk and can affect their services to customers in both the digital and physical domain.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
7.<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>Each country will no doubt, find its own unique balance between these competing objectives of data innovation and data protection.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>a.<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>India, I understand has a new draft Bill - the Digital Personal Data Protection Bill that recognises cross-border interactions as a defining characteristic of today’s interconnected world; in Singapore, we have our own data protection laws, since 2012, as do many other countries in the world.<br>
<br>
8.<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>In managing this important resource, we have taken a balanced approach, putting in place a progressive governance regime.<br>
<br>
<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>a.<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>One that allows for fair access and circulation of data, enabling cross-border data flows.&nbsp;<br>
<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>b.<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>And has appropriate safeguards to protect people from harm and unfair practices.<br>
<br>
9.<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>Today, I want to share with you three approaches that Singapore is advancing, together with international and industry partners, to facilitate trusted data flows across borders.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
10.<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span><strong>First, Singapore works with international partners to converge on standards to facilitate cross-border data flows</strong>.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
11.<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>Even as we differ in our data protection regimes, it is important that countries work towards interoperability between our systems.<br>
<br>
12.<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>Within ASEAN, we have worked together to create practical transfer mechanisms such as the ASEAN Data Management Framework (DMF).&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>a.<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>The ASEAN Data Management Framework provides businesses with a step-by-step guide so that their data management system has proper safeguards to protect data.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
13.<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>We also have Model Contractual Clauses, which are a ready-to-use template that help businesses meet the requirements for data transfers. Businesses, especially SMEs, can then reduce the amount of resources spent on negotiation and compliance.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
14.<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>We welcome the opportunity to work with India and other countries to encourage more of our businesses to utilise these data transfer mechanisms.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
15.<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>International certification mechanisms are another useful, data transfer tool.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>a.<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>An example is the Cross-Border Privacy Rules or CBPR system, which harmonises standards to reduce barriers to cross-border data flows.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>b.<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>Singapore is one of the founding economies of the Global CBPR Forum and we are working with government and industry partners to facilitate the adoption of the CBPR system globally.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
16.<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span><strong>Another way that Singapore is advancing trusted cross-border data flows is through working with industry and research partners on Privacy Enhancing Technologies.&nbsp;</strong><br>
<br>
17.<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>We are exploring ways in which businesses can extract value from data, without exposing sensitive personal data.&nbsp;<br>
<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span><br>
<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>a.<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>For instance, banks can now pool data from their operations world-wide and build AI models for better fraud detection, while protecting their customers’ information.&nbsp;<br>
<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>b.<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>We have just launched a Privacy Enhancing Technology sandbox and hope our experience will contribute to the development of a more trusted and innovative data ecosystem.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
18.<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>Earlier this year, Singapore also launched the National Digital Trust Centre with R&amp;D commitments. It is an initiative that allows businesses to experiment with emerging technologies in a safe and secure manner, enhancing trust between companies and citizens.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
<br>
19.<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span><strong>A third way to advance trusted data flows, is to invest in infrastructure platforms that allow for data exchange across sectors and borders.&nbsp;</strong><br>
<br>
<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>a.<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>An example of a public-private infrastructure platform is the Singapore Trade Data Exchange, or SGTraDex; consider it a secure data super-highway that aims to tackle supply chain inefficiencies by connecting partners in the ecosystem.&nbsp;<br>
<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>b.<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>It is expected to unlock more than $100 million in value for participants by 2026.&nbsp;<br>
<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>c.<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>We invite businesses around the world to utilise SGTraDex and to work together to develop more of such platforms that enhance business productivity.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Conclusion&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
20.<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>Three months ago, I was in Bali for the G20 Digital Economy Ministers’ Meeting, where I shared Singapore’s balanced approach to data and the importance of allowing for cross-border data flows.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
21.<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>India’s G20 Presidency comes at a critical juncture.<br>
<br>
<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>a.<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>India’s strength in the digital domain, for example the India Stack, puts it in a good position to lead global efforts on digitalisation, through the G20 fora.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
22.<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>I look forward to working closely with India and the rest of the world in harnessing the immense potential of data and the digital economy.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
23.<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>Thank you.</p>
