<li>
<p>You have heard from CE ACRA<sup>1</sup> and Min Indranee<sup>2</sup> on
the actions that they have set out to take with regard to Bizfile. My ministry
shares the responsibility for how events unfolded, and we too apologise
to the public for the anxiety caused.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As I explained in my opening remarks<sup>3</sup>, we had planned to discontinue
the use of masked NRIC numbers within the government, starting with new
services, and progressively changing out other services as they are updated.
For the private sector, we had intended to consult before making any change;
we should have made that clear.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We should also have made clear what we meant by moving away from using
masked NRIC numbers. It does not mean automatically unmasking and using
the full NRIC number in all circumstances. In other words, just because
we move away from using masked NRIC numbers, doesn’t mean that we switch
everything into an unmasked NRIC number, fully exposing the NRIC number.
In some instances, for example before the doctor performs a procedure or
a nurse dispenses us medication, it will be safer and more accurate to
use the full NRIC. In other instances, such as signing up for retail membership
or lucky draws, there is no need to use the NRIC number at all. There are
alternatives like mobile numbers or email addresses that can be used.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In other words, not using masked NRIC numbers does not mean that we will
unmask all currently masked NRIC numbers. We should have made this clear.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Having said that, I would like to re-emphasise why the current practices
around the use of NRIC numbers today makes us vulnerable, and why we should
act while the problem is relatively contained.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Think back to how our NRIC number is like our name. Even though our name
is not a secret, if someone we don’t recognise calls out our name and starts
to behave as though they know us well, we would be slightly suspicious.
We would be polite but not too friendly. We should certainly not share
too much with this person, just because they know our name.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the same way, this is how we should treat anyone who tells us our NRIC
number, as a way of suggesting that they know us well. We should be cautious
about our interactions. We should certainly be careful about revealing
more about ourselves, saying “yes” to their requests or following their
instructions without checking further. But this is not the case today.
We may assume a caller who can tell us our NRIC number to be a figure of
authority. This makes us vulnerable to potential scammers. Some organisations
also accept NRIC numbers – whether full or partial – as a way to prove
that the person is who he claims to be, and that allows him to access confidential
documents like e-statements or controlled services. This is not secure.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These practices and mindsets must change. We know this will take time.
That’s why we are not rushing to change policy. We will start by focusing
on the incorrect use of NRIC numbers and stopping such practices. This
means moving away from using the NRIC number as a password; and moving
away from using the NRIC number as an authenticator, to prove that a person
is who he claims to be. As I said earlier, within the Government, we are
taking steps to do so.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Here, it may be useful to contrast the NRIC number and the NRIC card,
because there is some confusion that they are the same. They are not. Let
me put this in personal terms, to be precise and specific. I can use my
NRIC card both to identify myself, and to prove I am who I claim to be.
The reason is not because my NRIC card contains my NRIC number, but because
the card also contains other information such as my photo and fingerprint,
that allows others to check that my NRIC card matches me, the person holding
the card; plus the fact that the NRIC card is not easily faked. But someone
providing my NRIC number and claiming to be me, is different from me producing
my NRIC card to prove that I am that person. Providing my NRIC number alone
should not be accepted as a way to authenticate that the person quoting
my NRIC number is actually me.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The proper way to handle NRIC numbers is spelt out in the PDPC’s Advisory
Guidelines on the use of NRIC. We will update the Guidelines to help put
a stop to the wrong uses of the NRIC number, and to give reassurance to
entities who have legitimate reasons to use the NRIC number. We will consult
industry before making any changes to the advisory guidelines. Meanwhile
the prevailing guidelines remain valid. Therefore, most organisations and
individuals can carry on with what they are doing to be careful and responsible
in how they collect and use NRIC numbers. They must continue to exercise
duty of care in their handling of NRIC numbers. For example, the numbers
should not be published unless there are good reasons to do so. For organisations
that are not using NRIC numbers, whether full or partial, as password or
authenticator, nothing has changed. But if they are, then they should stop
these practices as soon as practicable.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I would also like to address a related question on ACRA’s exemption from
PDPA requirements. The Government has always taken seriously its responsibility
to protect the data entrusted to the public sector and we continue to strengthen
our data governance practices. To be clear, the Government’s personal data
protection standards, set collectively by the Public Sector Governance
Act (PSGA) and our own internal rules, are aligned with the PDPA and adapted
to the public service context. So, it is not as though within the Government,
there are no rules. There is the PSGA and our internal rules. These internal
rules existed even before the PDPA and were updated when the PDPA came
into force. ACRA, like other public agencies, is expected to comply with
these rules and the Public Sector Governance Act, which are no less stringent
than the PDPA requirements, and often more stringent. For completeness,
ACRA is also permitted or required by laws like the ACRA Act and Companies
Act to share information, and it has to do so within the rules and PSGA
requirements.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To conclude, we are taking the public’s concerns on this matter seriously
and we want to offer them better protection.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We are not making drastic overnight changes. We do however need to move
decisively to phase out the incorrect uses of the NRIC number, the sooner,
the better.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This will allow us to more confidently use the full NRIC number as a unique
identifier. Thank you very much.</p>
