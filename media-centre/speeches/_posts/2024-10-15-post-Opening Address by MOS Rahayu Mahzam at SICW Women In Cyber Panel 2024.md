<p><strong>SPEECH FOR OPENING ADDRESS BY MOS RAHAYU AT SICW WOMEN IN CYBER PANEL ON 15 OCT 2024</strong>
<br>
</p>
<p>1. Distinguished guests, speakers, colleagues and friends. Good afternoon.</p>
<p>2. I am happy to be here with all of you at this year’s Women in Cyber
event.</p>
<p>3. The Women in Cyber event has been an integral part of SICW. We continue
this tradition year after year for a crucial reason: despite our growing
numbers, women working in cybersecurity continue to be a minority. It is
an important part of our work to promote the advancement of women.</p>
<p>4. However, this is not just about improving statistics. Creating and
sustaining trust in our digital world calls for a comprehensive, ecosystem-wide
collaboration. As cybersecurity threats become more sophisticated and impact
our communities, tapping into the unique perspectives and talents across
society is essential to strengthen our collective defences.</p>
<p>5. As we gather here this afternoon, we should think about the future
we can create together. A future where our security community become as
diverse and dynamic as the society we protect.</p>
<p>6. Having diverse backgrounds, unique approaches to problem-solving, and
fresh perspectives are not just beneficial – they are crucial in our fight
against cyber threats. In a field where thinking differently can mean the
difference between vulnerability and security, such diversity can be invaluable.</p>
<p>7. Today, we are here in a room full of women, and men, who are leaning
forward to join the big challenge that is cybersecurity. And there are
also many here who are leading the community. I am proud to be in the room
with so many women who are so distinguished in their fields.</p>
<p>a. Take for example, Cheri, the Chief Information Security Officer of
Temasek International. Cheri has the responsibility of overseeing Temasek’s
cybersecurity strategy and managing its cyber and IT risks. Her work involves
ensuring the company’s digital resilience and promoting best practices
within the wider network. With significant experience in cybersecurity
leadership, Cheri’s journey reflects the growing contributions of women
in this field and serves as an encouraging example for others looking to
pursue similar paths.</p>
<p><strong><u>Our diversity is key in building digital trust</u></strong>
</p>
<p>8. We are seeing significant changes in the cyber landscape. AI and quantum
will change the threats and risks we face. Each of these areas demands
deep domain expertise, as the problems we are facing are getting increasingly
complex and challenging.</p>
<p>9. AI is a good example. There are new emerging risks and unknowns on
how AI models can be manipulated and misused across different domains.
Existing threats such as cyberattacks, misinformation, disinformation,
and scams, are expected to increase in speed, scale and sophistication
once enabled by AI. This makes cyberthreats even more challenging to defend
against.</p>
<p>10. What we need is a concerted way to tap on talents across society.
We need to groom and equip more individuals who may not have traditional
cybersecurity experience to become more familiar with these concepts and
challenges. Through synergising their domain expertise with newfound cybersecurity
knowledge, these individuals will help strengthen our talent pipeline to
help tackle these evolving challenges.</p>
<p>11. To address this, CSA had rolled out the SG Cyber Associates programme
to provide cybersecurity training for various groups of non-cybersecurity
professionals, including many women in other sectors, to develop cybersecurity
skills relevant to their work.</p>
<p>12. Since the launch of the programme last year, CSA has worked with the
Law Society, Institution of Engineers Singapore (IES), Temasek Polytechnic
and ISACA to roll out short courses in specific technology domains such
as Internet of Things security, Governance, Risk, Compliance (GRC), and
legal frameworks in cybersecurity.</p>
<p>13. CSA will continue to work closely with the industry to identify training
topics that are in demand, such as AI security.</p>
<p>14. By having a workforce that is increasingly familiar with cybersecurity
concepts, we will be better equipped to create solutions that are not only
technically sound, but also nuanced towards the needs of the different
industries. These targeted cybersecurity trainings represent a step forward
in encouraging a collective effort to protect our cyberspace.</p>
<p><strong><u>Building new pathways in cybersecurity</u></strong>
</p>
<p>15. Besides training non-cyber professionals on cybersecurity, it is also
crucial that we actively build new pathways for women and others to join
us in cybersecurity.</p>
<p>16. One way we can do this, is through understanding the hurdles that
stand in the way of our women achieving a fulfilling career with abundant
opportunities for growth.</p>
<p>17. We want to make sure that cybersecurity is seen as a meaningful, rewarding
career, and that there are different pathways for a cybersecurity professional
to advance.</p>
<p>18. As such, CSA is embarking on a study of how we can effectively professionalise
Singapore’s cybersecurity workforce, including that for women and other
minority groups.</p>
<p>a. For Singapore, professionalising the cybersecurity workforce will allow
us to enhance the capabilities of our cybersecurity workforce, in addition
to strengthening our national security, and Singapore’s reputation as a
trusted business hub.</p>
<p>b. For organisations, clarity in standards and desired skills at various
roles will mean greater improvements in workforce competency and productivity.</p>
<p>c. At the individual level, cybersecurity becomes more appealing as a
long-term career when there are clear pathways for development, and practitioners
are recognised for their professional expertise, skills and qualifications,
both locally and internationally.</p>
<p>19. This comprehensive study will provide crucial insights to guide our
professionalisation efforts. It will:</p>
<p>a. Examine our industry’s readiness for professional standards</p>
<p>b. Identify what cybersecurity roles should be professionalised</p>
<p>c. Develop strategies for international cross-recognition.</p>
<p>20. Consultations with stakeholders from the Government, industry, training
institutions and certification bodies have begun, and we expect the study
to conclude early next year.</p>
<p>21. These findings will form the foundation of a robust framework to ensure
Singapore’s cybersecurity workforce meets world-class standards and remains
globally competitive. For our cybersecurity professionals in Singapore,
this means your skills and credentials will be recognised not just locally,
but on a global stage.</p>
<p>22. Having a clear roadmap for elevating the cybersecurity profession
in Singapore opens up new opportunities for all of us, especially women
looking to advance their careers in cybersecurity. It is about creating
an environment where your expertise is recognised, your contributions are
valued, and you see a clear and meaningful path forward.</p>
<p><strong><u>Conclusion</u></strong>
</p>
<p>23. So, to everyone joining us here today – whether as a seasoned professional
or just starting your journey in cyber – your voice matters. Your ideas
matter. Your presence in this field is not just welcomed, but deeply necessary.</p>
<p>24. We will continue to support your growth, your ambitions, and your
success in the cybersecurity field.</p>
<p>25. However, this has to be a community effort. Organisation leaders play
a vital role in championing women in cybersecurity within your own organisations.
Create mentorship programmes, offer growth opportunities, and actively
build a culture where women can thrive alongside their counterparts.</p>
<p>26. This journey of empowerment and inclusion will be an ongoing one.
We welcome you to join in this shared endeavour, and to share your feedback
and suggestions with us. This will ensure that we support your needs effectively.</p>
<p>27. We have a wonderful line up of women that are breaking new ground
in cybersecurity. I wish all of you a fruitful discussion, and look forward
to the panel insights into how we can continue to grow together and build
an inclusive and safe digital cyberspace.</p>
<p>28. Thank you.</p>
