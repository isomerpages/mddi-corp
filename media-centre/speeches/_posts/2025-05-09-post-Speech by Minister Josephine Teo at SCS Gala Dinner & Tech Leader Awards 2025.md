<h4>Opening Address by Mrs. Josephine Teo, Minister for Digital Development and Information, at SCS Gala Dinner &amp; Tech Leader Awards 2025 (9 May 2025)</h4>
<p>President of the Singapore Computer Society Ms Lim Bee Kwan,</p>
<p>Senior Minister of State Mr Tan Kiat How,</p>
<p>Distinguished Guests,</p>
<p>Ladies and Gentlemen,</p>
<p>1. I am happy to join you tonight for this year’s SCS Gala Dinner. Allow
me to first congratulate all the recipients of this year’s Tech Leader
Awards – well done!</p>
<p>2. About a year and a half ago, when I attended your 2023 Tech3 Forum,
I had noted how uncanny it was that the event was being held on polling
day for the Presidential Elections.</p>
<p>3. A few months ago, when I was browsing my calendar, I thought the SCS
may once again have picked a politically significant day for this event.
But it turns out the Prime Minister had other plans.</p>
<p>4. As it also turned out, so much attention had been drawn to the General
Elections in the last few weeks, that other very significant events for
the tech community went almost completely unnoticed.</p>
<p>5. The first of this is Singapore’s hosting of the annual International
Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR).</p>
<p>a. It is not an exaggeration to say that the ICLR is one of the top three
conferences where the world’s most prominent researchers in AI/ML gather.</p>
<p>b. Not only was ICLR being held for the first time in Asia, in-person
participation hit a new high of 11,000. ICLR has never had such high in-person
participation, and they did it in Singapore.</p>
<p>6. Along with ICLR, there were several other events fostering international
scientific exchanges in AI.</p>
<p>a. This includes the second edition of the <u>Singapore Conference on AI</u> (SCAI),
which I opened before starting on day four of election campaigning,</p>
<p>b. as well as the <u>Singapore AI Research Week</u>.</p>
<p>7. And because these events, many luminaries of the field spent good time
in Singapore, some for the first time.</p>
<p>8. For example, Yoshua Bengio, one of the three godfathers of modern AI
who spoke at SCAI.</p>
<p>a. He advocated passionately for stronger AI governance, which reinforced
my point about the importance of deepening exchanges between researchers
and policymakers, so that AI safety research can be translated into effective
policies that govern AI well.</p>
<p>b. Yoshua and over 100 other global leaders in AI, including Max Tegmark
of the Future of Life Institute, also contributed to <u>“The Singapore Consensus”</u> on
the priorities for global AI safety research.</p>
<p>i. While in Singapore, the experts identified three key priorities – Risk
assessment, developing trustworthiness, and controlling AI systems. You
can read about this in the latest edition of “Wired”.</p>
<p>ii. We hope that the “The Singapore Consensus” will serve as a new foundation
for global conversation on AI safety, and I look forward to sharing it
with other Digital Ministers at the upcoming ATxSummit in end-May.</p>
<p>9. Many other AI luminaries were in town last month too.</p>
<p>a. For example, in the midst of the hustings, I caught up with Yann Le
Cun, another of the three godfathers of modern AI, to discuss opportunities
in AI adoption.</p>
<p>b. It’s actually quite remarkable. What are the odds that two out of three
of the godfathers of AI were in Singapore in a single week?</p>
<p>c. I am heartened these luminaries made the time to speak to, and inspire,
our AI community as part of the 30+ activities at the <u>Singapore AI Research Week</u>.</p>
<p>10. I share these with you not because I’m an ambassador for the Singapore
Tourism Board excited about increasing tourism receipts.</p>
<p>11. But it’s really about the growing breadth and depth of AI activities
in Singapore, and the increasing awareness of the international AI community
about the possibilities here; and these are not to be disregarded.</p>
<p>12. After all, when we set out the vision of “AI for the public good,
for Singapore and the world” in our refreshed National AI Strategy, it
was precisely to anchor Singapore as a vibrant hub for AI innovations that
could have broader impact beyond our shores.</p>
<p>13. I am glad that this vision is steadily being realised, and there are
signs of a dynamic AI ecosystem taking shape here.</p>
<p>14. For example, Lorong AI has established itself as Singapore's premier
AI hub, and has anchored a strong and vibrant AI community in Singapore.</p>
<p>a. Its collaborative space regularly brings together over 200 AI practitioners
from across industry and Government to learn together and exchange new
ideas.</p>
<p>b. Lorong AI has hosted over 40 events in the four months since launch,
and continues to host multiple events weekly. These range from hands-on
product workshops to technical deep-dives that are conducted by our homegrown
AI experts, leading global researchers, and industry pioneers such as OpenAI
and AWS.</p>
<p>c. We are also seeing promising public-private partnerships start to form
out of Lorong AI. One such partnership explores the development of an agentic
tool to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of LLMs.</p>
<p>15. In Government, over 50,000 users, or one-third of all public officers,
regularly use Pair, an in-house secure version of ChatGPT, to enhance productivity.</p>
<p>a. Public officers have created thousands of experimental chatbots using
our AIBots platform, and have innovated solutions ranging from answering
HR queries to guiding colleagues through budget and procurement processes.</p>
<p>16. Many industry partners have also set up <u>AI Centres of Excellence (AI CoEs)</u> to
innovate, build, and deploy AI-enabled solutions in Singapore.</p>
<p>a. Last year, 26 AI CoEs were set up by companies across tech, healthcare,
manufacturing, and transport.</p>
<p>b. And we continue to see more.</p>
<p>17. Next January, we will also host the Association for the Advancement
of AI, or AAAI’s, <u>Conference on Artificial Intelligence</u> – A leading
AI conference that has traditionally only been held in North America.</p>
<p>18. As we grow our AI opportunities, I’m keenly aware of the concerns
about its displacement impact on workers. These concerns are real, but
we must also recognise that AI will create new jobs.</p>
<p>a. For example, as AI adoption grows across the many sectors in the economy,
there will be greater demand for AI talent to deploy, test, and ensure
its safety and governance.</p>
<p>b. We must therefore focus on anchoring more of these new jobs in Singapore.</p>
<p>19. To meet this future demand for more AI practitioners, we are actively
growing a strong pipeline of AI Practitioners with a view to triple our
pool from 5,000 to 15,000 over five years.</p>
<p>a. One of the ways we are doing so, is by providing more company-led training
opportunities under the IMDA’s <u>TechSkills Accelerator</u> (TeSA).</p>
<p>b. We are also expanding the <u>AI Apprenticeship Programme</u> together
with AI Singapore.</p>
<p>c. We estimate that the pool has already grown by nearly 25% in the last
year or so.</p>
<p>20. Besides targeted efforts in AI skills development, we will continue
to grow our bench of tech talent to meet companies’ needs.</p>
<p>a. One significant talent pool for employers are our polytechnic and ITE
graduates – an effort that our SMS Tan has been championing.</p>
<p>b. And the SCS, together with SGTech, have been strong advocates through
the <u>TIP Alliance</u> [TeSA for ITE and Polytechnic Alliance], for companies
to hire these graduates for skills rather than just academic qualifications.</p>
<p>21. At the same time, we will also nurture more Singaporeans to become
leaders in tech, like many of you are.</p>
<p>22. To do so, IMDA, has partnered with industry, including global tech
firms, to offer the <u>Singapore Digital Leadership Accelerator</u> (SGDLA).</p>
<p>23. Promising Singaporean tech professionals are given opportunities under
the Accelerator to gain global exposure in overseas markets.</p>
<p>24. They will also have the opportunity to be mentored by experienced
global tech executives or founders from a network that is 1,500-strong.</p>
<p>a. For example, 2022 SG Digital Leader, Gan Hao Yi was connected to his
mentor Chang Ling Siow through this network.</p>
<p>b. As mentor, Ling encouraged Hao Yi to consider Executive Management
education programmes for professional growth. Doing so has allowed Hao
Yi to advance to a larger role as the Head of Global Software Strategy
and Transformation at Dyson.</p>
<p>c. They remain in close contact with each other, seeking out new opportunities.</p>
<p>25. With this Accelerator, we hope to prepare many more Singaporeans to
take on senior leadership positions in MNCs’ global or regional headquarters,
or in high-growth start-ups.</p>
<p>26. I am happy to announce today, that 19 more Singaporeans have been
appointed as SG Digital Leaders this year. This brings the total number
of Leaders appointed to 68 since the programme was started in 2022.</p>
<p>a. They come from across the digital ecosystem, including product management,
AI, and emerging technologies such as quantum computing.</p>
<p>27. I look forward to more inspiring contributions from SG Digital Leaders
to Singapore and your fields.</p>
<p>28. And once again, to all recipients of the Tech Leader Award 2025 who
will be honoured tonight, congratulations. And thank you all, for your
very significant contributions to Singapore’s vibrant tech sector.</p>
<p>29. Have a great evening!</p>
