<p><strong>Opening Address by Dr Janil Puthucheary, Senior Minister of State, Ministry of Digital Development and Information, At the Amazon Web Services Asia Pacific Hub Opening (12 February 2025)</strong>
</p>
<p>Mr Jaime Valles, Vice President, APAC, Amazon Web Services,</p>
<p>Mr Jeff Johnson, Managing Director, ASEAN, AWS,</p>
<p>Ladies and Gentlemen,</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>1. Good morning everybody, and thank you very much for inviting me to
join you today. It is my pleasure to be here to celebrate the official
opening of Amazon Web Services’ (“AWS”) new Asia Pacific hub.</p>
<p>2. AWS established its office here in 2010. At the time, it was its first
expansion outside of the US and Europe. Since then, AWS has invested more
than S$12 billion in Singapore and has plans to double this investment
into its existing operations and cloud infrastructure, to more than S$23
billion by 2028. It has also grown its team to over 2,500 employees across
corporate, retail and technology functions. Thousands of customers have
leveraged AWS’ cloud services to power their digital transformation. Our
entire business ecosystem has been part of this process.</p>
<p>3. Today marks a significant milestone in AWS’ 15-year journey in Singapore.</p>
<p>4. Looking around this expansive 360,000 square foot space, there’s an
energy and sense of opportunity. I’ve also had the opportunity to visit
it and have a little bit of a preview. One of your partners organised an
event here and it was very exciting. It represents that continued confidence
that AWS has in Singapore, and is a testament to the vibrant digital ecosystem
that we have collectively built, together with business partners like AWS,
the government, and the people of Singapore. A future that is driven by
innovation, powered by technology and fuelled by talent.</p>
<p>5. Singapore has long recognised the transformative power of technology.
We understand that in today’s rapidly evolving world, digital adoption
is not just an advantage, it is a necessity, it is a critical factor in
how we do things.</p>
<p>6. And it has been a significant contributor to Singapore’s economic growth
and has created new opportunities for our people. In 2023, Singapore’s
digital economy generated a value-add of $113 billion dollars, equivalent
to about 17.7% of Singapore’s nominal GDP.</p>
<p>7. With technologies like AI, the boundaries of our productivity can be
pushed further, and the competitiveness of our industries can be strengthened.</p>
