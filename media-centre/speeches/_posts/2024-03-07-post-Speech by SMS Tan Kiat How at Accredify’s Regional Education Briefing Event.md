<p>Quah Zheng Wei, CEO &amp; Co-founder, Accredify</p>
<p>Esteemed Guests,</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Good morning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is my pleasure to be here for Accredify’s inaugural “Regional Education
Briefing”.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One key pillar of our ForwardSG agenda, which is the next phase of how
Singapore will progress and is one of the key agenda of our next generation
of political leaders in this new realm, is “embracing learning beyond grades,”
focusing on skills.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This includes creating more diverse pathways to develop potential, and
making lifelong learning a part of our social compact.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Several new initiatives were also announced at Budget 2024 just last month
to help our workforce reskill and upskill. For students, we will continue
to offer varied pathways and customised learning experiences to support
students’ diverse potential. The Government has been working closely with
industry and businesses in several ways on this front.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For example, in my ministry, we formed the TechSkills Accelerator for
ITE and Polytechnic Alliance, or TIP Alliance for short. Together with
IMDA, industry partners and the schools, we come together to provide opportunities
for our polytechnic and ITE graduates in technology.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This has resulted in numerous enhanced internships, apprenticeship placements
and work-study opportunities for these students.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our close collaboration with industry partners like SGTech and Singapore
Computer Society, as well as our Institutes of Higher Learning, ensures
that our curriculum remains relevant for these students, so that they are
equipped with industry-relevant skillsets, beyond just achieving good grades.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For individuals already in the workforce, we will continue to invest in
them to allow them to re-skill and upskill. National initiatives such as
the TechSkills Accelerator, or TeSA for short, have helped to upskill approximately
17,000 locals to secure rewarding tech employment opportunities. This is
done in close partnership with companies, through TeSA place-and-train
programmes such as company-led training.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A new initiative announced at Budget 2024 is the SkillsFuture Level-Up
Programme, which seeks to support mid-career Singaporeans aged 40 and above
in undertaking significant reskilling and upskilling to boost their prospects
in their current job or pivot to a new career.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I must add that through these programmes, these are not just policies
and schemes but the close partnership that we have with our industry partners,
companies, and schools, that is precious. I've had the chance to meet many
of the students in these programmes. For example, we talked about getting
mid-careerists to pivot to the tech industry with various good jobs, but
these jobs are not so accessible for someone who does not have enough of
the necessary background experience and skills.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We've been running programmes and I'm very glad that the partnership between
the companies hiring these potential new candidates and the training partners
– whether a school, an Institute of Higher Learning, or a training provider
that is under our scheme – work very closely together.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One important part of this is Place and Train. Many of these training
providers provide an allowance while the person is going through training,
and we have a number of such training providers under the TeSA scheme.
The government also provides financial support and funding support for
these new schemes, and I've seen very good outcomes.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Last year, I was at one of the programmes and I was chatting with the
mid-career students, and I asked them what they used to do before joining
this programme. Some of them are currently doing cybersecurity related
roles, while others are in software coding and digital marketing. Their
backgrounds are very diverse. One of them was a full-time professional
musician but COVID-19 came, and they did not have as many gigs outdoors
playing for audiences. During that period, he went for one of the Government
supported schemes to learn a new skill and found out that he likes technology,
and mentioned that coding is like writing music. And he is now in the tech
industry.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In this, it gives me encouragement that these pathways are creating opportunities
for a diverse group of Singaporeans of different backgrounds, even age
groups, but what they have in common is the interest and the perseverance
to go through the training. It's not easy to pick up new skills, especially
for someone older, but I respect them, and we want to support as many of
them as possible in this new social compact.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Government has been doing a lot and will continue to do more to support
our students, Singaporeans, and workers. But employers have an important
role to play.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Traditionally, employers have relied on academic qualifications to determine
a candidate’s abilities. However, this approach has its limitations. Academic
qualifications do not always reflect the industry-relevancy of an individual’s
competencies and skillsets, given that the half-life of skills grows shorter
by the day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many of the examples I spoke about just now don’t have a degree in computing
or diploma in digital technologies, but they have the skills to do the
job, and they may be better at the job than someone who has a degree and
diploma.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Further, focusing on academic qualifications limits the pool of potential
talent. There are diverse means to acquire a wide range of skillsets today,
including in tech, from open-source programmes to community-led initiatives,
and many of the government programmes in Singapore.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is why we launched the Skills-Based Hiring Handbook for Tech Roles
last year, that aims to promote skills-based hiring practices among employers
and job seekers. This provides a valuable resource to help companies make
the move to focus on skills rather than on qualifications. Such a move
benefits companies and workers alike.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For many employers, it is not just about HR practices, but it is also
about a change in mindset and we wanted a movement to get more progressive
and like-minded companies to come on board to join us, lead the way, and
show that it can be done.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And we have many success stories. Today, we have 200 companies pledging
their support to join this movement and it’s very encouraging to see. Companies
can tap on a wider pool of talent and find a candidate with the necessary
skills for the job. Job seekers will be assessed based on their tech skills
and potential, instead of being evaluated solely on one’s academic qualifications.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A skills-based framework for talent development and attraction requires
a scalable but trusted platform where certificates can be verified and
trusted by parties involved. Technology has made it easier for people to
fake documents, potentially exacerbated by generative AI developments.
How can we use technology to reliably authenticate the qualifications and
skills of individuals? You can have the programmes and intention, but you
need to actually get it done.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am very glad that Accredify is doing that for many partners today. Today,
the use of blockchain platforms such as OpenCerts have been deployed across
Institutes of Higher Learning in Singapore. These platforms allow learners
to receive their certificates electronically, where the authenticity of
digital certificates can be validated and trusted. This greatly reduces
costs, time, and effort for the otherwise manual verification processes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But I think more can be done. I therefore commend Accredify’s efforts
to bring together partners from different countries to seek commitment
towards the harmonisation of academic and skills-based credentials, allowing
individuals to showcase their skills and competencies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is important for regional stakeholders to develop and collaborate on
improving qualifications and verification processes that will strengthen
digital trust in the region’s education and training ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am very heartened to see friends from China, India, Indonesia, and Singapore,
which include government and private sector partners such as the Centre
for Student Services and Development (CCSD), VFS Global, Maxy Academy,
and SeeMeCV.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This signifies the importance that we have placed on using technology
as an enabler for education, not just in transmitting knowledge through
distance learning, but also to apply blockchain technology on verification
of qualifications across regions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By harmonising digital certificates, it omits the need to translate certificates
that are issued in foreign languages. This will go a long way, and help
to promote cross border talent mobility and uplift societies, to not just
people coming to Singapore but for Singaporeans going abroad.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In closing, I thank the Accredify and the regional partners today for
making the effort to empower our learners, educators and communities through
education and innovation. Together, we can build a future where every individual
is able to access opportunities across borders, reach his or her potential,
and where knowledge becomes a catalyst for positive change.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you.</p>
