<p><strong>OPENING REMARKS BY MINISTER FOR DIGITAL DEVELOPMENT AND INFORMATION JOSEPHINE TEO AT THE SICW ASEAN MINISTERIAL CONFERENCE ON CYBERSECURITY ON 16 OCT 2024</strong>
<br>
<br>My ASEAN Ministerial colleagues</p>
<p>Secretary-General of ASEAN Dr. Kao Kim Hourn</p>
<p>Distinguished guests</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen</p>
<p><strong><u>Introduction</u></strong>
</p>
<p>1. Good morning. It is my pleasure to welcome you to this 9th ASEAN Ministerial
Conference on Cybersecurity, or AMCC.</p>
<p>2. The presence of ASEAN Ministers, Secretary-General of ASEAN, senior
officials, and Dialogue Partners here signifies our shared commitment towards
strengthening our regional cybersecurity architecture.</p>
<p>3. Since the AMCC last year, the cyber threat landscape has continued
to evolve. Ransomware attacks, scams and other cybercriminal acts are just
some of the many challenges that occupy our collective attention.</p>
<p>4. Take ransomware for example, the threat continues to escalate.</p>
<p>5. New groups like RansomHub and Brain Cipher have burst onto the scene
and quickly gained notoriety by engaging in “big game hunting” – that is
targeting and successfully breaching high-profile victims. Government entities
and services are prized targets because these groups stand to gain significant
notoriety and payouts given the widespread public impact.</p>
<p>6. Suffice to say, ASEAN faces these challenges as well. ASEAN is a young
and dynamic region, with a digital economy poised to grow from USD 300
million to USD 1 trillion by 2030. We have a combined population of close
to 700 million with a significant proportion of young, educated, online-savvy
individuals and a growing middle class.</p>
<p>7. We are also fast adopters of the latest technologies like smart devices
that enable the remote monitoring of everything from transportation nodes
to air quality. While these technologies are very convenient and easy to
use, they have also greatly expanded the attack surface area of our respective
States.</p>
<p>8. However, I am confident that if we stand together, we will be able
to strengthen our cyber defences and safeguard our digital future.</p>
<p><strong><u>Strengthening Regional Cooperation in the Face of Emerging Threats</u></strong>
</p>
<p>9. Since the AMCC was initiated in 2016, we have taken substantive steps
to strengthen ASEAN’s cyber resilience.</p>
<p>10. At the ASEAN Digital Ministers’ Meeting in February this year, the
Ministers endorsed the Financial Model of the ASEAN Regional Computer Emergency
Response Team or CERT, a key initiative in our regional efforts to advance
operational coordination and the timely exchange of information to respond
to cyber threats.</p>
<p>11. Today, I am pleased to announce the launch of the physical facility
of the ASEAN Regional CERT, which ASEAN ministers and senior officials
will be officiating later.</p>
<p>12. With USD10 million pledged over 10 years in funding, the ASEAN Regional
CERT represents a concrete step in ASEAN’s efforts towards regional capacity
building and sharing of best practices. The ASEAN Regional CERT will also
support our efforts in developing partnerships with industry and academia,
facilitate and conduct cyber exercises, and enhance timely information
exchanges.</p>
<p>13. With a physical facility, the ASEAN Regional CERT will now have a
dedicated venue to host workshops, training sessions, and regional exercises
to uplift our collective capacity in the face of new and emerging cyber
threats.</p>
<p>14. The ASEAN Regional CERT’s activities will be governed by a Taskforce
led by an ASEAN Member State as Overall Coordinator. This role will be
rotated biennially. I am sure all fellow ASEAN Member States would fully
render our support to Malaysia as the first rotating Overall Coordinator
of the ASEAN Regional CERT.</p>
<p>15. The work and priorities of the ASEAN Regional CERT are already underway.
The taskforce’s inaugural meeting in Singapore on 16 August 2024 was chaired
by Dr Megat Zuhairy bin Megat Tajuddin, Malaysia’s Chief Executive of the
National Cyber Security Agency to discuss the next steps to operationalise
the ASEAN Regional CERT.</p>
<p><strong><u>ASEAN is Committed and Ready to Actively Contribute to the establishment of a secure, trusted, interoperable and rules-based cyberspace</u></strong>
</p>
<p>16. ASEAN is also fully committed to contribute towards to the global
efforts to strengthen the rules-based order in cyberspace.</p>
<p>17. The adoption of and adherence to a multilateral system of voluntary
rules, norms, and principles is not a just theoretical concept. These form
the foundation for a secure and prosperous digital future for all.</p>
<p>18. Dialogues, and platforms like the Singapore International Cyber Week
and the AMCC, are key to enhancing these efforts.</p>
<p>19. At the 3rd AMCC in 2018, ASEAN was the first regional grouping to
subscribe in-principle to the United Nations’ 11 voluntary and non-binding
norms of responsible State behaviour in the use of ICTs.</p>
<p>20. Since then, we have worked diligently to translate these norms into
actionable steps.</p>
<p><strong>21. I am pleased to announce that the ASEAN Norms Implementation Checklist led by Singapore and Malaysia, with the strong support from our fellow ASEAN Member States, was completed in September this year.</strong>
</p>
<p>22. The Checklist builds upon wider UN efforts to implement voluntary
non-binding norms of responsible State behaviour in the use of ICTs. It
identifies practical steps that relevant government agencies can consider
when implementing the norm, and corresponding capacity-building activities
that can be adopted to meet the norm.</p>
<p>23. With methodically-detailed guidance, I am confident the ASEAN Checklist
will go a long way to support ASEAN Member States in their implementation
of cyber norms, in line with their respective national priorities.</p>
<p>24. This is the first Checklist of its kind. We would be happy to share
our experience with other countries in the implementation of these norms
in support of global efforts towards an open, secure, stable, accessible,
interoperable, and peaceful cyberspace.</p>
<p>25. The ASEAN-Singapore Cybersecurity Centre of Excellence and the ASEAN-Japan
Cybersecurity Capacity Building Centre are other examples of the achievements
that we have accomplished together as ASEAN and our partners.</p>
<p>26. We made progress on these efforts because as a region, we have a clear
vision that is articulated in consecutive five-year ASEAN Cybersecurity
Cooperation Strategies. The Strategy was first launched in 2017 and subsequently
renewed in 2021.</p>
<p>27. I note that under the leadership of our Malaysian colleagues at the
National Cyber Security Agency, the effort to review the existing strategy
has started so that it can chart the way forward for the next five years.
I am confident that this effort will inspire new areas for collaboration.</p>
<p><u>Conclusion</u>
</p>
<p>28. Colleagues, Ladies and Gentlemen, this year’s ASEAN theme under the
Lao PDR’s chairmanship is “Enhancing Connectivity and Resilience”.</p>
<p>29. We should take advantage of the time we have together this week to
engage in dialogue to deepen our cooperation and embrace the opportunities
of a secure and resilient cyberspace.</p>
<p>30. I look forward to our discussions at the AMCC and wish everyone a
fruitful conference.</p>
<p>31. Thank you.</p>
