<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>A very good morning and it is my pleasure to join you today at the third
AI Health World Summit.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>I commend the SingHealth Duke-NUS Academic Medical Centre and A*STAR for
convening this community from across borders, disciplines, and industries.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>All of us here have the shared goal to transform healthcare in our communities
and are joined in the belief that AI plays an important role to achieve
this aim.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Singapore has always been a firm believer in using technology to overcome
our many constraints – land, labour and small market size.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In this regard, AI is a technology with significant potential.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="6" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Our healthcare sector had embraced AI early on.</p>
<p>a. For example, our radiologists were amongst the earliest adopters in
using AI to detect anomalies in medical scans.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Generative AI has further opened up new possibilities for clinical efficiency.</p>
<p>a. An example is SingHealth’s Note Buddy tool that was launched last August.</p>
<p>b. The tool transcribes and summarises consultations in real-time and
in different languages.</p>
<p>c. It reduces the doctors’ administrative workload, freeing them to have
more meaningful interactions with their patients.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Importantly, AI has also given us the capability to adopt a more personalised
approach to medical intervention, at scale and at lower cost.</p>
<p>a. An example is the Singapore General Hospital’s AI2D (Augmented Intelligence
in Infectious Diseases) model. The model personalises antibiotic prescriptions
for patients, reducing the risk of antibiotic resistance.</p>
<p>b. Another example is AI Singapore’s CURATE.AI that optimises chemotherapy
doses for individual patients.</p>
<p>c. Instead of basing medical interventions just on population-based clinical
trials, these early efforts have the potential to improve intervention
outcomes by enabling decisions to be informed by an individual’s unique
responses to biomarkers related to genetics, lifestyle, and medical history.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AI also improves our predictive capabilities, allowing doctors to shift
more interventions upstream towards preventive care.</p>
<p>a. For example, aiTriage, a cardiac risk tool developed by the Singapore
General Hospital, Duke-NUS Medical School, and DxD Hub, can predict a patient’s
risk of a major cardiac event in the next 3 or 30 days.</p>
<p>i. Using just an ECG device and mobile app, healthcare workers can identify
at-risk patients and make triaging decisions in under 7 minutes, thereby
significantly improving the chances of someone surviving a cardiac arrest.</p>
<p>b. These early detection capabilities are also valuable in peri-operative
medicine. CARES 2 is one such surgical risk model.</p>
<p>i. Developed by the Singapore General Hospital and National University
of Singapore, it can predict the likelihood of post-operation complications,
and inform the need for re-admission or ICU admission. These predictions
facilitate early interventions.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AI gives us the tools to go further upstream, for example looking at how
we can shape behaviours early and reduce disease risks well before symptoms
emerge.</p>
<p>a. An example is a partnership between the National University of Singapore's
Schools of Medicine and Computing, and Carnegie Mellon University's Heinz
College of Information Systems and Public Policy, along with FriendsLearn
Inc – a technology inventor and translation partner.</p>
<p>b. They will establish a Centre of Excellence in Singapore for the use
of AI in precision prevention, via what we call ‘digital vaccines’.</p>
<p>c. These digital vaccines use neurocognitive training, implicit learning,
and immersive gaming to encourage healthier behaviours in children – safely
and effectively priming neurodevelopment and gut biome health.</p>
<p>d. This induces and reinforces changes at the neuro-physiological level
underlying behaviours and choices, during the critical habit-formation
stage of childhood. We look forward to tracking how this method can improve
lifelong health and cognitive wellbeing for generations to come.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We are scratching at the surface of the immense possibilities that AI
brings to healthcare.</p>
<p>a. Cutting-edge projects are transforming the way we study pathology and
design medical interventions.</p>
<p>b. Take for example Google Deepmind’s new AlphaProteo system. It can generate
new molecule binders for proteins associated with cancer and diabetes,
helping regulate critical cellular processes.</p>
<p>c. We are coming closer to targeting proteins once thought ‘undruggable’,
and conditions thought incurable.</p>
<p>d. With these advances, we can possibly cure many more forms of cancer
in our lifetime!</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The implications of these advances are profound.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="13" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>But equally remarkable is how they've emerged from the intersection of
different fields – computer science, molecular biology, clinical medicine
and more.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="14" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>This convergence of expertise reminds us that our greatest breakthroughs
come not from technology alone, but from bringing diverse minds together.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="15" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Such interdisciplinary conversations must begin by bringing together different
parts of the ecosystem.</p>
<p>a. This is why our national healthtech agency, Synapxe, launched its HEALIX
analytics platform last year to consolidate data infrastructure across
our public hospitals. With a unified secure platform for AI development,
HEALIX makes analytics projects with anonymised national data possible.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We are also bridging the gap between research and clinical implementation.
At the recent Budget Debate in Parliament, DPM Heng spoke of the importance
of ‘bilingual’ talent – researchers who combine AI research with domain
expertise like many of you in the audience here today.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="17" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>This focus on applied AI research is crucial. The Government has committed
$120 million to the AI for Science programme. This initiative supports
the integration of AI and scientific research, including in the biomedical
and health sciences fields.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="18" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>To sustain this flow of research to practice, we will continue investing
in platforms for interdisciplinary learning and application.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="19" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Today, I am pleased to launch the SingHealth Duke-NUS AI in Medicine Institute,
or AIMI.</p>
<p>a. This Institute will bring together expertise from SingHealth and Duke-NUS
Medical School, with four priorities.</p>
<p>i. First, to spearhead research in frontier AI technologies, including
foundation models and agentic AI.</p>
<p>ii. Second, to champion AI literacy, fostering a culture of informed adoption
amongst healthcare professionals and the public alike.</p>
<p>iii. Third, to bridge the gap between research and real-world application,
driving the global commercialisation of innovative AI projects.</p>
<p>iv. Fourth, to lead the development of robust ethical guidelines, which
emphasise responsible AI, patient safety, and data privacy.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The priorities of this institute highlight some of the challenges that
lie ahead of us.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="21" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>When we last held this Summit in 2023, GenAI had just taken the world
by storm. Since then, global perspectives towards AI have matured, with
a clearer view of its actual benefits and risks.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="22" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Trust must be our North Star.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="23" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Trust has always underpinned healthcare; our communities, our patients
entrust us with their lives.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="24" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>But with AI, we tread a fine line between medical breakthroughs and risks.
Challenges from algorithmic transparency to unrepresentative training data
may undermine the safety of AI solutions, and erode patients’ trust in
the healthcare institutions and professionals.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="25" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>That is why we must not lose sight of robust governance and the focus
on patient outcomes even as we experiment and innovate with new technologies.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="26" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>We must bring together key stakeholders in the development process - clinicians,
researchers, policymakers, and importantly patients and their families.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="27" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>It is this collective effort that builds trust, where collaboration and
shared commitment lead to lasting confidence. This is why efforts like
today’s Summit are critical.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="28" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>It is in this spirit that I am also heartened to witness the signing of
an MOU between SingHealth and the Coalition for Health AI, or CHAI.</p>
<p>a. CHAI is a US-based non-profit organisation, dedicated to establishing
guidelines and best practices for safe, effective, and equitable AI across
healthcare.</p>
<p>b. CHAI brings together academic health systems, organisations, and expert
practitioners, with members including Google, Johns Hopkins University,
Mayo Clinic, Microsoft, and Stanford Medicine.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The MOU being signed today is a pledge of commitment by both organisations
to raise awareness of responsible AI use in healthcare.</p>
<p>a. This will involve the co-creation of AI guidelines, publications, and
policy recommendations, ensuring that the use of AI in healthcare remains
ethical, transparent, and focused on transforming patient care.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are many exciting opportunities and possibilities lie ahead of us
– as a community, as society, as humanity. But let us always remember the
true measure of AI’s success in healthcare is not the technical advancements
but its ability to improve lives.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="31" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>I wish everyone a fruitful Summit.</p>
</li>
