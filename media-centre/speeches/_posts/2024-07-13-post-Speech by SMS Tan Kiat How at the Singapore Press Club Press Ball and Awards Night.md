<p>Mr Patrick Daniel, President, Singapore Press Club, Excellencies,</p>
<p>Distinguished Guests,</p>
<p>Ladies and Gentlemen</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>A very good evening. Thank you for having me tonight at this year’s Singapore
Press Club Press Ball and Awards Night.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’m very glad that the annual Awards recognise rising young stars in journalism
and public relations, and excellence in sustainability journalism.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tonight I would like to offer my heartiest congratulations to, first the
inductees in the Hall of Fame. You have shown dedication and commitment
to your field of work. I would also like to offer my heartiest congratulations
to all the nominees. You thought about sustainability journalism, climate
change, and I'm very glad that tonight we see corporates and media working
together hand in hand to raise awareness on sustainability-related issues
among Singaporeans, and also more importantly, calling for action to be
taken.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All of us can play a part. Sustainability and our drive towards a net
zero future is one of the greatest challenges that we will face around
the world for our generation, and I think many generations to come, and
certainly in Singapore. So tonight, I would also like to touch on another
driving force that will shape our future for many generations to come.
That is around technological change and disruptions, especially in the
area of artificial intelligence, including Generative AI, and what's the
role of media in this age of AI?</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>The continual disruption of the media landscape</u></strong>
</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All of us here tonight would be keenly aware of how the internet has transformed
the media industry. The speed of change has not slowed.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We saw a significant change in media consumption patterns from pre- to
post-pandemic, a span of less than five years. For example, let us look
at frequent reach, which is defined as news consumption of at least several
days a week.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>According to our News Consumption Survey, frequent reach of print is at
20 per cent, a drop by nearly half from pre-COVID times. In contrast, frequent
reach of digital news sites increased from 60 per cent in 2019, to 73 per
cent in 2023.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Audiences desire instant gratification. They want their news fast, preferably
in bite-sized nuggets that they can easily consume and forward on. In some
ways, this trend has led to a loss in appreciation for quality, well-researched,
long-form news content.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Furthermore, with lower barriers of entry, social media, citizen journalists,
and alternative content platforms have joined the fray. This relentless
competition for attention has upended newsrooms’ traditional revenue models.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A 2019 study by the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism found
that traditional news organisations struggle to generate sufficient revenue
from digital subscriptions and advertising to make up for the loss in print
revenue. Another study by Northwestern University found that between 2005
and 2022, approximately a quarter of USA newspapers have shut down.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Closer to home, the Utusan Malaysia, one of Malaysia’s oldest newspapers,
ceased all print and online editions in 2019 due to financial difficulties,
though it was relaunched a year later after receiving a cash injection.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then there is the tension between old and new models. Social media platforms
and news publishers are now intertwined, with the former disseminating
vast amounts of content from the latter.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But how will the cost and returns be shared fairly and sustainably between
the parties? Australia passed the News Media Bargaining Code in 2021 that
requires Google and Meta to pay news publishers for content used on their
platforms; Canada, Brazil, and Indonesia have since followed suit or are
considering similar steps. I don’t think this matter will be settled any
time soon.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All these changing tides have made it ever more difficult for news outlets
to thrive, or even survive.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But there is a silver lining to these dark clouds of change. Singaporeans
continue to trust our local media, as many of you have remained dedicated,
resilient, and committed to the highest standards of journalism. You have
pushed the boundaries of innovation, creating works that have captured
the attention of your audiences.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But today, we find ourselves at the cusp of another significant disruption
from the rapid technological advancement in AI, especially generative AI.
Some of the existing tensions and challenges I mentioned earlier are not
going away. In fact, with more likelihood, AI and Gen AI will further accelerate
some of these trends.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>Riding the AI wave together</u></strong>
</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AI’s capabilities are potentially transformative – it has powered new
tools that enhance productivity and creativity in newsrooms, providing
new ways to create and engage with content, and streamlining newsroom operations.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For example, Google has been testing its AI tool, Genesis, to produce
news stories to help improve work efficiencies for journalists. Other AI
tools available in the market include QuillBot that helps with paraphrasing
and rewriting content, and Copy.ai which transforms users’ prompts into
content.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many reputable news outlets have also developed similar tools. The Associated
Press has used AI to generate automated stories, such as straightforward
sports recaps. The BBC has implemented AI translation tools to offer news
in various languages, allowing its global audience to access news in their
preferred languages.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our local newsrooms have been quick in leveraging these tools to drive
efficiencies and allow our newsroom talents to focus on what they do best:
discovering important stories, telling Singapore stories to the world and
helping Singaporeans better understand what is happening around the globe,
and getting them out to the public.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For instance, with the rise of short-form video content, CNA has developed
its own in-house solution, AI SmartCut, which allows news bulletins and
other long-form video content to be readily adapted into bite-sized clips
– something that would previously have to be done manually by a video editor
over a course of hours.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SPH Media has tapped on AI for better audience engagement, with its news
apps leveraging AI to provide personalised news feeds, push notifications,
and interactive features.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AI interactive tools for fact-checking have also aided journalists in
upholding the accuracy and authenticity of the information they publish.
This is especially important given today’s dangers of the spread of misinformation
and AI-powered deepfakes.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maintaining this trust is paramount to preserve the credibility of the
news outlets, of the media industry, with your audiences, listeners, viewers
and readers. They trust the news you publish, even with the knowledge that
AI could have some part to play in producing the news – because they believe
in you, as trusted news professionals, using AI under editorial oversight,
without compromising on journalistic integrity and depth.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some of you might ask – will AI replace journalists one day? AI is certainly
getting more intelligent, and ChatGPT can generate a straightforward news
report at speeds that are humanly unattainable. But it is also essential
to recognise the art of journalism where human judgment cannot be replicated
by machines.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is here, within this blend of human judgment and technological assistance,
where the future of journalism will take place. Our task is to harness
these technologies wisely, ensuring they augment our strengths and do not
replace the fundamental human touch that is at the heart of all meaningful
journalism.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On our part, the Government will continue to be a partner of the media
by investing in strengthening your capabilities and ensuring that our newsrooms
remain trusted and relevant in the face of technological changes. Partnerships
will be crucial in providing the necessary training and resources to empower
journalists and media practitioners to excel, and even thrive, in an AI-enhanced
media landscape.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We are also investing in the broader digital landscape to ensure AI and
other emerging technologies do not harm our society. The Digital Trust
Centre and the Centre for Advanced Technologies in Online Safety are examples
of the Government’s commitment to building capabilities in this area.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While the future of the media continues to be uncertain, there is a degree
of excitement. The stark options are there. Are we to sink or swim – to
resist change and be left behind; or reinvent ourselves to remain relevant.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have full confidence that the media industry in Singapore, not just
newsroom journalists, but also media practitioners and those in PR and
marketing, have rode the wave of the internet and social media over the
last two decades, and in recent years, especially so. I am confident that
the sector can rise to the new challenge of harnessing AI. Keep innovating,
invest in capabilities and remain relevant to stakeholders, and above all,
safeguard zealously the precious trust with the public.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>Conclusion</u></strong>
</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Within this context, I am certain the Singapore Press Club will continue
to be an important part of the Singapore media story through a changing
landscape. You are already putting in much work into keeping your members
up to date with global newsroom trends, such as your News Impact talks
that have covered AI and sustainability, and important issues such as greenwashing.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you to all members of the press and others within the media community,
for continually contributing to the culture of excellence within our media
sphere. Thank you very much, I wish all of you a wonderful evening ahead.</p>
