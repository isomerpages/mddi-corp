2. The ROK and Singapore share a strong partnership in the digital space. Recently, on 21 November 2022, both countries signed the Korea-Singapore Digital Partnership Agreement (KSDPA) in Singapore to strengthen our digital trade architecture and deepen our digital connectivity, especially through collaborations in new and emerging technologies such as AI.  
  
3. Minister Teo met with the ROK’s Minister of Science and ICT, Mr. Lee Jong-Ho, and re-affirmed the areas of digital cooperation set out in the KSDPA and discussed on areas of mutual interest relating to the digital economy. Building on the KSDPA, the highlight of the trip was the signing of the Korea-Singapore AI MOU on 6 December by Minister Teo and Minister Lee. The MOU is a milestone in digital partnership between the two countries, and will allow the exchange of AI technologies and experiences in promoting the responsible use of AI.  
  
4. The ROK is a like-minded partner with strong research capabilities, industry-academia partnerships, and AI talent. Under the MOU, Singapore’s Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI), Smart Nation and Digital Government Office (SNDGO), and Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA), will work together with the ROK’s MSIT to:  
   
i. Increase access to AI technologies and talent: This will aid in bringing cutting-edge Korean technology and talent to Singapore to drive impactful AI use-cases;  
ii. Link research and industry activities to support the commercialisation of AI applications: This will accelerate the translation of AI research into commercial applications in both countries for the benefit of all stakeholders;   
iii. Strengthen the exchange of AI best practices: This will help both countries improve AI policies and strategies by learning from each other’s successes and shortcomings; and  
iv. Support the alignment of AI governance frameworks: Such efforts will facilitate responsible development and adoption of AI by the industry, potentially reduce costs for companies in implementing trustworthy AI solutions, and contribute to the development of international standards in AI.
