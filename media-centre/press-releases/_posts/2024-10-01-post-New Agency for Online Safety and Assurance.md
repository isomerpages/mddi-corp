<p><strong>New Agency for Online Safety and Assurance</strong>
</p>
<p>1. The Ministry of Digital Development and Information (MDDI) and the
Ministry of Law (MinLaw) have been studying measures to enhance online
safety and provide stronger assurance to victims of online harms. We intend
to introduce new legislation to allow victims of online harms such as cyber
bullying and intimate image abuse to seek civil remedies from their perpetrators.
A new agency will also be set up to support victims to seek timely relief
from specified online harms and promote responsible behaviour online.</p>
<p>2. In 2023, a survey by SG Her Empowerment (SHE)<sup>1 </sup>found that
38% of respondents had personally experienced some form of online harm.
Of all the respondents who experienced harmful online content or conduct,
26% encountered sexual harassment or cyberbullying. Many of victims want
the swift removal of harmful online material affecting them. Victims, experts,
and community organisations that we have consulted have called for more
effective ways of seeking recourse and putting a stop to the continued
presence of the harmful online materials.</p>
<p>3. Time is of the essence as online harm can easily go viral, amplifying
the effect on victims. A 2024 survey by MDDI found that among those who
reported harmful content on designated social media services, 8 in 10<sup>2</sup> experienced
issues with the reporting process. There is therefore a need to improve
the timeliness and effectiveness of relief to victims. Perpetrators should
also be held accountable for the harms suffered by victims.</p>
<p>4. Singapore will be among the first in the world to establish a dedicated
government agency to support victims of online harms and enhance online
safety. In Australia, the eSafety Commissioner investigates cyberbullying
of children, adult cyber abuse, image-based abuse (sharing, or threatening
to share, intimate images without the consent of the person shown), and
the propagation of illegal and restricted content<sup>3</sup>. Victims
of online harms can submit a report to the eSafety Commissioner, who will
act on the report if it meets the threshold for action.</p>
<p>5. Likewise, in Singapore, victims of specified online harms will be able
to submit an application to the new agency to seek redress. The new agency
will act on behalf of victims to direct perpetrators and online service
providers such as social media services to put a stop to the online harm
quickly. This provides added assurance on top of existing regulatory levers
and court-based processes available today and enhance online safety for
Singapore users.</p>
<p>6. The new agency will focus on the most serious and prevalent online
harms affecting victims in Singapore. Examples of such harm include cyberbullying
and the non- consensual sharing of intimate images.</p>
<p>7. To complement the efforts of the agency in supporting victims of online
harms, we will continue our public education efforts, including raising
awareness about the risks of online harms, what the public can do to prevent
and protect themselves against such harms, as well as the avenues of recourse
available to victims under the proposed legislation.</p>
<p>8. We will share more details in the coming months.
