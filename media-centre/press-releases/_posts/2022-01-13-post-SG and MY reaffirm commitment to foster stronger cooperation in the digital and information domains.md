<p>1.<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Communications and Information of&nbsp;Singapore, Ms Yong Ying-I and the Secretary General, Ministry of&nbsp;Communications and Multimedia of Malaysia, Dato’ Sri Haji Mohammad bin&nbsp;Mentek co-chaired the virtual 5th Joint Committee Meeting (JCM) on Information&nbsp;and Communications Co-operation between the Government of the Republic&nbsp;of Singapore and the Government of Malaysia on 13 January 2022.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
2.<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>Hosted by Singapore, and building on discussions from the previous meeting&nbsp;in 2020, this iteration of the JCM had a strong digital theme. Ms Yong and&nbsp;Dato’ Sri Mohammad discussed digital transformation efforts in their respective&nbsp;countries, and explored areas where bilateral digital co-operation could&nbsp;advance post-pandemic recovery.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
3.<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>Both parties discussed issues relating to enabling trusted data flows between&nbsp;the two countries, and to better connecting the respective innovation and&nbsp;technology ecosystems to support businesses and start-ups. In addition, both&nbsp;are committed to implementing projects to demonstrate the benefits of&nbsp;co-operation in this rapidly developing digital domain to support the recovery of&nbsp;our respective economies.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
4.<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>In addition, the JCM also discussed how media production, distribution and&nbsp;consumption are being disrupted by technologies and online platforms,&nbsp;including growing volumes of information and the rapid spread of falsehoods.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
5.<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>Ms Yong said, “The JCM is a platform of increasing importance, to deepen the&nbsp;bilateral co-operation between Singapore and Malaysia. The pandemic has&nbsp;driven many companies to digitally transform and seize new opportunities.&nbsp;Through the JCM, we have initiated meaningful digital co-operation projects to&nbsp;increase the adoption and interoperability of digital technologies in both&nbsp;countries. Our collaboration will serve as a springboard to enhance connectivity&nbsp;between our businesses and people, and to support our recovery from the&nbsp;pandemic.”&nbsp;<br>
<br>
6.<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>Dato’ Sri Mohammad highlighted, “Malaysia continues to embrace digital&nbsp;technology and develop unique technologies and business models to assist the&nbsp;country in establishing new development engines. With the growth of the digital&nbsp;economy, the Fourth Industrial Revolution, and ever-evolving technology,&nbsp;Malaysia looks forward to explore potential collaboration in this sector in the&nbsp;future. Malaysia is stepping up efforts to assist Micro, Small and Medium-Sized&nbsp;Enterprises (MSMEs) and business owners in adopting digital technology, and&nbsp;will continue to advance plans to establish an inclusive and progressive digital&nbsp;economy for all.”&nbsp;<br>
