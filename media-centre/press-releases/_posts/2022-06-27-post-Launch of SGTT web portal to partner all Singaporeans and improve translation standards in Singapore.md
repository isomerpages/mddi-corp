1. To encourage Singaporeans to be part of ongoing efforts to uplift translation standards in Singapore, the Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI) launched the collaborative SG Translate Together (SGTT) web portal. Senior Minister of State for Communications and Information and Chairperson of the National Translation Committee (NTC), Mr Tan Kiat How, was the Guest-of-Honour at the launch.

2. The SGTT web portal (sgtranslatetogether.gov.sg) enables members of public to generate translations and contribute post-edited translation data. It also features the customised SG Translate machine translation engine, which has been trained with localised data to suit the Singaporean context. The SG Translate machine translation engine was first rolled out for use by Government agencies in 2019, and has since generated more than 300,000 translations.

3. The key features of the web portal include the following:

* Bi-directional localised translations from English to Singapore’s other official languages – Chinese, Malay and Tamil – and vice versa accessible for all members of public.

* One-stop repository of translation events and translation-related resources.

* Members of public who are keen to contribute post-edited translations and take on translated tasks on the web portal can do so by registering with their Singpass. These translations will be used to further train the underlying neural machine translation engine to improve the accuracy of SG Translate.

4. At the event, Mr Tan also recognised the contributions of community partners such as the ‘Friends of SGTT’ – comprising individuals who have a deep passion for language and translation, and have participated in the beta phase of the web portal – and NTC members in raising translation standards in Singapore. More information on the NTC can be found in the [Annex](/files/Press%20Releases%202022/annex%20a%20(7).pdf).
