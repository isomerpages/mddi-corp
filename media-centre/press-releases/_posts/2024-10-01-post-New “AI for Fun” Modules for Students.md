<p><strong>New “AI for Fun” Modules for Students</strong>
</p>
<p>1. Jointly offered by Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) and
the Ministry of Education (MOE), the Code for Fun (CFF) programme<sup>1</sup> was
first introduced in 2014 to MOE primary and secondary schools. It exposes
students to computational thinking through coding, inventive thinking through
digital making, and emerging technologies. More than 50,000 students are
reached every year.</p>
<p>2. With the launch of MOE’s “Transforming Education through Technology”
Masterplan 2030 in 2023, IMDA and MOE are strengthening efforts to better
prepare our students and teachers for a digital future. Starting from 2025,
we will introduce new “AI for Fun” modules under the CFF programme. These
five to 10-hour elective modules will be made available to all primary
and secondary schools. The new “AI for Fun” modules will offer students
further opportunities for hands-on exploration and ‘tinkering’ with technology,
such as through the design of prototypes incorporating artificial intelligence
(AI). For example, students will get to understand what a smart robot is
and train such robots to respond to external signals.</p>
<p>3. The new elective modules will build upon the 10 hours of CFF that are
currently offered to primary and secondary schools. These cover basic coding
concepts such as variables, loops and functions in a block-based coding
platform, and a basic understanding of AI. Secondary school students also
dive deeper into computational thinking and design- thinking concepts and
learn how to apply them to create a solution for a real-world problem.</p>
<p>4. Beyond the CFF programme, students also acquire relevant digital literacies,
such as understanding AI, its uses, risks, and limitations, and ethical
considerations in the course of learning different subjects in schools.
Teachers guide students to use AI to support their learning, emphasising
ethics related to the use of data and AI, such as the importance of academic
integrity and proper data handling. Students are also taught how to verify
the credibility of online information sources and the importance of data
security, privacy, and responsible online behaviours. They can further
their learning through school-based programmes such as co-curricular activities,
Applied Learning Programmes, and enrichment programmes.

<hr>
<p><sup>1</sup>Since 2020, the Code for Fun Programme, or a comparable coding
programme, has been mandatory for all upper primary students. While CFF
remains an optional programme at the secondary school level, almost two
thirds of secondary schools offered the programme in 2023.</p>
