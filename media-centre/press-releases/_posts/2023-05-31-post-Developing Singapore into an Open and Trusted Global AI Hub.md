*Google Cloud and Ministry of Communications and Information collaborate to advance Singapore’s national AI strategy*

1. [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/) and the [Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI)](https://www.mci.gov.sg/) shared plans to collaborate to bolster Singapore’s national artificial intelligence (AI) vision and strategy.  
  
2. Potential focus areas of this strategic partnership announced at Google Cloud Singapore Summit 2023 are aimed at supporting the adoption and development of innovative, responsible, and inclusive AI technologies to maximize opportunities arising from Singapore and the region.  
  
3. “We welcome the opportunity to work with Google Cloud as we develop our plans to support the growth of the digital economy, and realize the benefits that AI brings to our people and enterprises in a safe and responsible way,” said Andrea Phua, Director, Digital Economy Office, MCI.  
  
4. Google Cloud’s next generation AI infrastructure, best-in-class GPU hardware, Vertex AI platform, and AI managed services and tools are already available to the technology ecosystem in Singapore so they can implement AI at scale. Working together, Google Cloud and MCI will also look to:

    * Accelerate the development of home-grown AI technologies: A trusted AI model marketplace hosted on Google Cloud for developers and businesses to access the best of Google’s AI solutions and foundation models, so they can develop capabilities like conversational AI, enterprise search and more;
    * Build a sustainable pipeline of talent for the future AI economy: Skilling initiatives to deepen AI capabilities and competencies, including possible support for eligible start-ups to take advantage of Google Cloud’s open AI ecosystem;
    * Supercharge the adoption of cloud AI technologies in Singapore: Development of incubators and accelerators that encourage developers, startups, and businesses to innovate using Google Cloud’s generative AI (Gen AI) technologies; and
    * Root Singapore’s AI progress in Responsible AI: Possible collaboration in AI governance and operationalization of Responsible AI principles.

5. "AI, and generative AI in particular, will have a profound and long term impact on community and commerce. Working together, we will create a vibrant AI ecosystem and thriving AI startup economy, accelerate business transformation and innovation, and develop the AI capabilities of Singapore's workforce," said Karan Bajwa, vice president, Google Cloud Asia Pacific.
