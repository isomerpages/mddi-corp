<p><strong>#HEART&amp;SOUL: CONNECTED BY SMART NATION SHOWCASE</strong>
</p>
<p>1. Singaporeans can look forward to the #Heart&amp;Soul: Connected by
Smart Nation showcase, which will be launched towards the second half of
2025 at the library@orchard.</p>
<p>2. The showcase will illustrate how digital transformation is impacting
and improving the lives of Singaporeans, as part of the Smart Nation 2.0
vision launched by Prime Minister Lawrence Wong on 1 October 2024. The
showcase will take the visitor through a multi-sensorial and immersive
journey to experience the power of digital technology. They will learn
more about how various Smart Nation initiatives across the public, private
and people sectors will enable everyone to thrive, and grow together in
a digitally inclusive society.</p>
<p>3. Through the experience, visitors could discover new ways to learn,
and gain greater confidence about using digital technology. In turn, they
may be inspired to embark on their personal digital journeys that will
connect them to new knowledge, interests, and with one another.</p>
<p><strong>Glimpse of future library</strong>
</p>
<p>4. The showcase will be held at the library@orchard as part of its revamp,
which was announced in September 2024. At the end of its run, selected
sections from the showcase will remain in the library when it reopens as
a more experimental library space. These sections will help to continue
to inspire NLB patrons to read, learn and discover well into the future.
The library@orchard is expected to fully reopen in the second half of 2026.</p>
<p>5. More details of the showcase will be announced in due course.</p>
