**Keeping seniors entertained and well-informed**

4. A collaboration between the Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI) and Mediacorp, “I Want To Be A Towkay”《亲家，冤家做头家》is part of the ministry’s continuous efforts to keep seniors updated on the latest government initiatives through&nbsp; entertaining content in dialects they are familiar with. The main characters will be speaking in Mandarin, as well as Hokkien, Teochew or Cantonese. There will also be some scenes where Hainanese and Hakka can be heard.

5. “Dialect programmes have been helpful for the Government to inform seniors and help them to understand relevant Government schemes and policies that benefit our seniors, such as reducing the cost of living and healthcare costs, support for older workers, and helping seniors meet retirement needs. Such programmes are also entertaining and produced in a language that our seniors are comfortable with. We hope that our seniors will enjoy watching ‘I Want To be A Towkay’." says Aaron Lye, Director, Campaigns and Production Department, Ministry of Communications and Information.

6. Veteran actor Zheng Ge Ping, who is the Executive Producer of the show, says, “We are happy to collaborate with MCI once again to deliver a high quality dialect drama that explores the theme of active aging and other issues relevant for seniors. We believe our viewers can gain valuable insights and useful knowledge from the show, and we hope everyone enjoys it!”
