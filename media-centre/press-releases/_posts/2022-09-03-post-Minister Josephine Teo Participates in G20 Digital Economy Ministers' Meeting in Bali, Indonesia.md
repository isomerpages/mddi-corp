<br>
2.<span style="white-space: pre;"> 		</span>At the G20 Digital Ministers’ Meeting, the Ministers demonstrated a shared commitment in navigating the post-pandemic recovery through digital transformation. Minister Teo made the following key points:&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On Connectivity and Post-COVID 19 recovery</span></strong><br>
<br>
i.<span style="white-space: pre;"> 		</span>Going digital had helped many of our SMEs deal with disruptions in supply chains and manpower shortages during the pandemic, and the challenge now is to keep up this momentum of digital transformation, amidst many other pressing demands.<br>
<br>
ii.<span style="white-space: pre;"> 		</span>To <strong>harness digitalisation as a catalyst for growth, </strong>Singapore has:<br>
<br>
<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>a)<span style="white-space: pre;"> 		</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Made consistent investments in our digital infrastructure ahead of time</span>, to build a robust and resilient communications network to support business and innovation. We are on track for nationwide 5G standalone outdoor coverage by 2025 or earlier and will be the first country in the world to extend public 5G standalone coverage to sea to drive innovation and real-time data exchanges in our maritime domain;<br>
<br>
<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>b)<span style="white-space: pre;"> 		</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Provided support to our SMEs and developed a core set of digital utilities</span> that companies can use, such as e-invoicing and e-payments, so that they can plug into the digital ecosystem from the get-go;<br>
<br>
<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>c)<span style="white-space: pre;"> 		</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Facilitated the building of an open and inclusive network of international partnerships</span> to create opportunities for our businesses, including by pioneering Digital Economy Agreements (DEAs) to facilitate digital trade with our partners.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br>
On Data Governance and Cross-Border Data Flow&nbsp;</strong></span><br>
<br>
i.<span style="white-space: pre;"> 		</span>Data is a resource that powers the global digital economy, especially when data flows across the borders. It drives efficiency and supports innovation. At the same time, we need to ensure that we have robust data governance standards to mitigate the risks and potential harms to our citizens and our society. Every country will have to find our own unique balance between these competing objectives, depending on our respective systems of governance and societal values. But even as we differ in our data protection or privacy regimes, it is important that we work towards enhancing interoperability between our systems, and to build an inclusive network and to avoid fragmentation between different regions and across the world.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
ii.<span style="white-space: pre;"> 		</span>Singapore has been taking steps together with partners around the world, to help move discussions from principles to pragmatic action:<br>
<br>
<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>a)<span style="white-space: pre;"> 		</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Developed and championed practical mechanisms </span>such as the ASEAN Data Management Framework (DMF) and ASEAN Model Contractual Clauses (MCCs), as well as the Cross-Border Privacy Rules (CBPR) system, that allow for interoperability of systems and the safe and secure transfer of data;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>b)<span style="white-space: pre;"> 		</span>Launched the National Digital Trust Centre, a national effort to focus on key areas of trust technologies. We are also exploring the potential of Privacy Enhancing Technologies, or PETs, to find ways in which businesses can extract value from data, without exposing sensitive personal data. For instance, we have just launched a PET sandbox, and hope that our learnings from this sandbox will contribute to the development of a more trusted and more innovative data ecosystem.<br>
<br>
