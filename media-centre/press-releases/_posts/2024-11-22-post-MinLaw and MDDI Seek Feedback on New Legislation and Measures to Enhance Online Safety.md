<p><strong>MinLaw and MDDI Seek Feedback on New Legislation and Measures to Enhance Online Safety and Better Protect Singaporeans from Harmful Online Content</strong>
</p>
<p>1. The Ministry of Law (MinLaw) and the Ministry of Digital Development
and Information (MDDI) launched a public consultation today to seek feedback
on proposed legislation and measures to enhance online safety. The proposals
target to enable victims of online harms to obtain assistance, and increase
the accountability of those who are responsible for online harms.</p>
<p>2. The public consultation will run for one month, until 22 December 2024.</p>
<p><strong>Background</strong>
</p>
<p>3. Harmful online content and conduct continue to affect many in Singapore
and around the world. At the launch of Smart Nation 2.0 on 1 October 2024,
Prime Minister Lawrence Wong announced that the Government would introduce
new legislation and measures to provide stronger assurance to victims,
including setting up a dedicated agency to improve protection for them.</p>
<p>4. These proposals form part of the Governmentâ€™s commitment to tackling
online harms and will enable victims to remedy the damage suffered from
online harms. They will also help shape the norms of acceptable online
conduct and improve accountability among members of the online ecosystem.
These proposals complement our existing regulatory framework and the criminal
justice system.</p>
<p>5. In summary, the proposed reforms will:</p>
<p>a. Introduce a <u>complaints mechanism</u>, administered by the new agency
to provide timely assistance to victims of online harms.</p>
<p>b. Introduce <u>statutory torts</u> for various online harms, to provide
legal certainty should victims of online harms choose to pursue redress
against responsible parties in court to hold them accountable through liability
for online harms.</p>
<p>c. Increase accountability through improved user information disclosure.</p>
<p><strong>Public Consultation</strong>

<p>6. MinLaw and MDDI are seeking feedback on these proposed reforms. The
