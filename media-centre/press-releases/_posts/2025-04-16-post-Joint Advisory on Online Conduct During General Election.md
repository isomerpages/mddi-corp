<li>
<p>The Singapore Police Force (SPF) and the Ministry of Digital Development
and Information (MDDI) would like to remind members of the public to observe
appropriate online conduct during the General Election.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Singaporeans have the right to participate in online discussions on the
General Election but should refrain from the following behaviours which
may constitute offences under the law.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Misinformation and Disinformation in the Online Space</strong>
</p>
<ol start="3" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>During the election period, there will be a high volume of online campaigning
and political discourse on social media and private messaging services.
Members of the public should be cautious about the information and materials
they receive during this period and be alert to misinformation. Persons
with ill intent may create online posts containing falsehoods or manipulated
content such as deepfakes, to deceive the public and influence the outcome
of the election. There have been numerous instances of manipulated videos
and photos appearing during election campaigning across the world. These
days, we no longer need sophisticated tools and techniques to create deceptive
content. They are easy to produce.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Members of the public should take care not to post or share content containing
falsehoods and misleading or manipulated content. If unsure about the content,
do not forward or repost them. Instead, verify the information against
official sources. The spread of misinformation and disinformation may affect
the integrity of our General Election.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Persons who spread misinformation and disinformation online may be liable
for an offence of communicating false messages under Section 14D of the
Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act 1906. Persons who
knowingly communicate online falsehoods that are against the public interest
may also be liable for an offence under Section 7 of the Protection from
Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act 2019. Persons who publish digitally
generated or manipulated election-related online content that misrepresents
a candidateâ€™s actions or words during the election period may be liable
for an offence under Section 61MA of the Parliamentary Elections Act 1954.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Online Harassment</strong>
</p>
<ol start="6" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Acts of harassment are punishable under the Protection from Harassment
Act 2014. Members of the public are advised not to make online comments
that may cause harassment, alarm or distress to another person. This includes
online doxxing of persons by publishing the personal information of the
person or persons related to him in order to harass, threaten or facilitate
violence against them. Members of the public should engage in online discussions
on the General Election in a civil manner.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Online Posts with Racial or Religious Connotations</strong>
</p>
<ol start="7" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Members of the public should not make online posts which may wound the
racial feelings of any person, promote enmity between different groups
of people on grounds of race, or which are prejudicial to racial harmony,
as they may constitute offences under the Penal Code 1871.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Members of the public should not engage in conduct that urges violence
or incites hatred or ill-will on religious grounds or against other religious
groups, as these may constitute offences under the Maintenance of Religious
Harmony Act 1990. SPF will not hesitate to take offenders to task.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The online space has become an important platform for communication and
exchange of information. SPF and MDDI would like to remind members of the
public to engage in responsible online behaviour to safeguard the integrity
of the General Election.</p>
</li>
