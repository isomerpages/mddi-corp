1. The Minister for Communications and Information has directed the POFMA Office to order Facebook to disable access for Singapore users to States Times Review (STR) Facebook page, under Section 34 of the Protection against Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act.

2. The STR Facebook page has repeatedly conveyed falsehoods and not complied with any of the POFMA Directions that it has been served with. After being served a Declaration on 15 Feb 2020 notifying that it was declared a Declared Online Location (DOL), the STR Facebook page has not carried the required notice stating that it has been declared a DOL, which serves to warn visitors of the previous falsehoods that this page communicated.

3. For facts of the case, please refer to the Factually article, “Corrections And Clarifications Regarding Falsehoods Published By States Times Review on the COVID-19 Situation” ([https://www.gov.sg/article/factually-clarifications-on-falsehoods-posted-by-str-on-covid-19-situation](https://www.gov.sg/article/factually-clarifications-on-falsehoods-posted-by-str-on-covid-19-situation)).
