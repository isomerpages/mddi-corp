1. Following PM Lee’s announcement on S377A at the National Day Rally 2022, the Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI) reaffirms the Government’s position that the repeal of S377A does not mean that we are changing the tone of society. This position also applies to our policies on media content.

2. MCI and the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) regulate media content to protect younger audiences from age-inappropriate content, and at the same time enable mature audiences to make informed choices over a diverse range of content. Media content with higher reach and impact is subject to more stringent requirements.

3. To understand the community’s views, IMDA regularly consults its advisory committees, made up of members of the public from all walks of life, on specific titles as well as content guidelines and regulations.

4. Our content regulatory approach has to be sensitive to societal norms and values. We will continue to take reference from prevailing norms. LGBT media content will continue to warrant higher age ratings.
