<p>Today, at the Google Cloud Singapore Summit 2023, the <a href="https://www.smartnation.gov.sg/about-smart-nation/sndgg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Smart Nation and Digital Government Office (SNDGO)</a> and
<a href="https://cloud.google.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Google Cloud</a>announced the launch of the Artificial Intelligence Government
Cloud Cluster (AGCC), a comprehensive platform designed to accelerate AI
adoption in Singapore’s public sector, advance local research efforts in
applied AI, and support the growth of the local AI startup ecosystem.</p>
<p>SNDGO and Google Cloud have implemented the AGCC for use by Singapore’s
government agencies and <a href="https://www.nrf.gov.sg/rie-ecosystem/ecosystem/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">research, innovation, and enterprise (RIE) ecosystem</a>.
The AGCC is hosted in a dedicated cloud computing environment in Singapore.
Through the AGCC, agencies can take advantage of Google Cloud’s enterprise-grade
AI technology stack and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/google-cloud-at-io-2023" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">extensive partner ecosystem</a> of
software-as-a-service companies, consultancies, and AI startups to build
and deploy scalable and impactful AI applications quickly, securely, responsibly,
and cost-effectively.</p>
<p>Capabilities from Google Cloud’s AI technology stack include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>AI-optimized infrastructure</strong>: High-performance <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/a2-vms-with-nvidia-a100-gpus-are-ga/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">A2 supercomputers</a> powered
by NVIDIA’s A100 Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and hosted on Google
Cloud’s open, scalable, secure, and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/sustainability" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">energy efficient</a> infrastructure.
This enables cloud engineers to train computationally intensive AI models
at high velocity, while optimizing cost and mitigating the associated environmental
impact.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Customizable first-party, third-party, and open-source AI models</strong>:
A <a href="https://cloud.google.com/model-garden" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">central repository</a> for
AI practitioners to access pre-trained generative AI models, with integrated
features to help them <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/vertex-ai-model-garden-and-generative-ai-studio" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">customize</a> these
models for specific needs. The repository hosts a variety of first-party,
third-party, and open-source models that are built for different tasks.
These include models for summarizing and translating text in multiple languages,
maintaining an ongoing conversation, turning audio into text, creating
studio-grade images from text descriptions, and generating and fixing software
code. International AI startups that are looking to make their foundation
models available to government agencies in Singapore can work with Google
Cloud to host these models on the repository.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>No-code AI developer tools</strong>: A <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/create-generative-apps-in-minutes-with-gen-app-builder" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Generative AI App Builder</a> for
developers—including those with limited technical skills—to quickly build
<a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/original_images/1_Gen_App_Builder_chat.gif" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">chatbots</a>and <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/original_images/2_Gen_App_Builder_search.gif" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">enterprise search</a> experiences
powered by Google Cloud’s generative AI models, and seamlessly embed them
into applications and websites.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="https://cloud.google.com/explainable-ai" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Explainable AI</a></strong> and
data governance toolkits: A suite of built-in tools that can help government
agencies deploy AI securely and responsibly. This includes features for
access control and content moderation, unique mechanisms for incorporating
human feedback to improve model performance, and the ability to <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/explainable-ai/overview" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">audit</a> the
sources behind AI models’ outputs to detect and resolve potential bias
and ensure that model behavior is <a href="https://cloud.google.com/security/compliance" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">compliant</a> with regulations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Government Technology Agency (GovTech)</a> is
the first public sector organization in Singapore to leverage the AGCC.
Its <a href="https://open.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Open Government Products (OGP)</a> team
has integrated with Google Cloud’s Vertex AI and is exploring the use of
its models in Pair, which are large language model-powered assistants that
civil servants can use to help them boost their productivity, with privacy
and security safeguards in place to maintain the confidentiality of government
information.</p>
<p>To enable government agencies to deploy AI applications most effectively
and responsibly, Google Cloud will partner with GovTech to design and run
whole-of-government Digital Academy programs that help agencies build in-house
data science and AI expertise, develop AI innovation strategies, and implement
<a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/data-governance-in-the-cloud-part-2-tools" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">data governance best practices</a>. These training programs are an expansion
of Google Cloud’s <a href="https://www.smartnation.gov.sg/media-centre/press-releases/23082022/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">existing public sector skilling commitments</a>.
The programs will be offered in various tailored forms to 150,000 public
officers across 16 ministries and more than 50 statutory boards.</p>
<p>Sherie Ng, Country Director, Singapore, Google Cloud, said: “AI can shape
the public sector’s digital service delivery in profound and meaningful
ways – from <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/public-sector/document-ai-government-makes-it-easier-process-documents-and-deliver-better-constituent-services" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">automating data entry</a>,

and more. Beyond providing Singapore government agencies with access to
advanced and truly open AI technologies, we look forward to working with
GovTech to build a vibrant pool of homegrown talent across a range of AI-related
roles in public service, to help advance Singapore’s <a href="https://www.smartnation.gov.sg/initiatives/artificial-intelligence/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">national strategy</a> for
deploying scalable and responsible AI innovations."</p>
<p>From June 2023, government agencies in Singapore can access the AGCC and
other accredited Google Cloud services through the Government Commercial
Cloud (GCC) 2.0 platform. Built by GovTech, the GCC platform provides agencies
with a consistent and regulated way to adopt commercial cloud solutions.
GCC 2.0, the second iteration of the platform, is integrated with cloud-native
capabilities and cloud security practices, allowing agencies to tap a wider
ecosystem of services and talent to accelerate the development of modern
digital applications.</p>
