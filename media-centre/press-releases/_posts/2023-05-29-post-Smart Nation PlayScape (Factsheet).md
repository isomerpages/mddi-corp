<h2>Factsheet – Smart Nation PlayScape</h2>
<p><strong>29 May 2023</strong>
</p>
<p>Smart Nation PlayScape aims to demystify technology and inspire young
Singaporeans to be curious about future technologies through a series of
fun and immersive exhibits. Guests can learn about the variety of digital
technologies powering Smart Nation initiatives and discover the different
possibilities that these technologies have to offer.</p>
<p>Smart Nation PlayScape consists of eight zones of exhibits:

<p><strong>Exhibit 1A: Sensors I</strong>
<br>This exhibit shows how different sensors can tell us important details
about our bodies.
<br>
<br>Guests can step into the booth and have their vitals (e.g. height, weight,
breath rate) read using different sensors. They can even take a special
thermal camera selfie that shows their body heat.
<br>

</div>
<p><strong>Exhibit 1B: Sensors II</strong>
<br>This exhibit showcases how sensor networks help collect and visualise
different types of data, which guides operators to make better decisions.
<br>
<br>Guests can learn how the network of sensors around Singapore provides
important information such as weather, taxi, air and sea traffic in real-time.

<p><strong>Exhibit 2: Geospatial</strong>
<br>This exhibit showcases how locational technology helps us to do better
land planning and build well-designed and community-centric neighbourhoods.
<br>
<br>Guests can play a game with the use of building blocks reflecting the
different elements of a city (e.g. hospitals, parks, schools) to improve
the quality of life in the city they are building.
<br>

<p><strong>Exhibit 3A: Biometrics I</strong>
<br>This exhibit shows how biometric data – such as our facial features and
fingerprints – is processed with a high degree of accuracy and speed, to
recognise us as individuals.
<br>
<br>This multi-player game will challenge players to express an emotion, which
the machine will rate using facial recognition technology. The player rated
with the ‘best’ matching expression wins.

</div>
<p><strong>Exhibit 3B: Biometrics II</strong>
<br>
<br>This exhibit explains how one of the most common biometric authentication
methods – fingerprint scanning, works!
<br>
<br>Guests can analyse their fingerprint, identify their fingerprint pattern
and find out how common or rare their patterns are in relation to others.

</p>
<p><strong>Exhibit 3C: Cybersecurity</strong>
<br>
<br>This exhibit educates guests on the importance of staying cybersafe in
a world full of growing cyber threats.
<br>

<br>
</p>
<p><strong>Exhibit 4: Blockchain</strong>
<br>
<br>This exhibit demonstrates how blockchain works by creating a system based
on mutually verified questions and answers.
<br>
<br>In this interactive exhibit, guests answer a riddle individually. Only
when all players enter the same answer (i.e. mutual agreement), there is
consensus, and a ‘block’ is added to the chain.

</p>
<p><strong>Exhibit 5A: AI, Data Analytics I</strong>
<br>
<br>This exhibit showcases how Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be trained
to serve us better - by inputting clean data for it to analyse, visualise
and create predictive models.
<br>
<br>In this multi-player game, players challenge each other to drawing simple
objects that the AI machine is trained to identify.

<br>
</p>
<p><strong>Exhibit 5B: AI, Data Analytics II</strong>
<br>
<br>This exhibit shows how machine learning works by teaching a computer to
identify patterns and to make decisions based on data.
<br>
<br>Players can ‘train’ a computer to identify and differentiate various animal
shapes (e.g. dog, cat, rabbit), by placing it in front of a camera, without
writing any code.

<p><strong>Exhibit 6A: Robotics I</strong>
<br>
<br>This exhibit highlights how robots can learn or do things as well as (or
better than) humans.
<br>
<br>Guests can scramble a Rubik’s Cube and place it in a machine to watch
how quickly the robot solves it.

<p><strong>Exhibit 7: UX and Services</strong>
<br>
<br>This exhibit helps guests to understand the basic principles of good User
Experience (UX) design, and how to apply them to meet the needs of different
users.
<br>
<br>Guests can play a series of games to design an app using UX principles.
They also get to experience issues encountered by some end-users, such
as colour blindness and short-sightedness.

<br>
<br>This exhibit shows guests the possibilities of Virtual Reality (VR), allowing
guests to explore places that they might not have access to or perhaps
have yet to visit.
<br>
<br>In this interactive exhibit, users get to ‘travel the world’ by experiencing
the unique sights of different places like Aurora Storms in Greenland,
Mount Rigi in Switzerland, Coral Reefs in Philippines, and Pyramids in

<p>
<br>
</p>
<p><strong>Exhibit 8B: AR &amp; VR</strong>
<br>
<br>This exhibit demonstrates how Augmented Reality (AR) can help make learning
more immersive, by overlaying digital content onto the real world.

<br>In this interactive experience, guests can grow virtual plants on a tabletop
garden scape and pick up basic gardening skills by selecting the best growing
conditions for their plant.

<p><strong>Central Display: Everyday Tech</strong>
<br>
<br>The central display called ‘Cabinet of Curiosities’, features a collection
of objects that showcase how technology is already shaping our lives –
from how we stay healthy, to how we shop, travel and play.
<br>
<br>Guests can explore an assortment of objects, categorised into four themes,
with each object telling a story about a specific technology.
