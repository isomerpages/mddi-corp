<li>
<p>Gutzy Asia’s (“Gutzy”) website and Gutzy’s social media pages on Facebook
and X (formerly known as Twitter) (the “online locations”) have been declared
as Declared Online Locations [1] (“DOLs”) under the Protection from Online
Falsehoods and Manipulation Act 2019 (“POFMA”). The Declaration was issued
by the Minister for Communications and Information on 11 June 2024 and
will come into effect on 12 June 2024.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Declaration was made following multiple falsehoods communicated on
the online locations. The Declaration will be in effect for two years,
until 11 June 2026. During the period that the Declaration is in effect,
Gutzy’s website, Facebook page and X account page, are each required to
carry a notice, stating that each of these online locations has been declared
as a DOL. With the notice, visitors to these DOLs will be warned that Gutzy
has a history of communicating falsehoods on these online locations (see <u>Annex</u> for
details).</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Declaration does not mean that the DOLs will need to cease operations.
Gutzy’s website, Facebook page and X account page may remain in operation.
However, the statutory requirements under Part 5 POFMA relating to, amongst
others, the de-monetisation of the DOLs, must be complied with. POFMA prohibits
a person from deriving financial benefit from operating a DOL, thereby
preventing operators of DOLs from profiting from the communication of falsehoods.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During the time that the Declaration remains in effect:</p>
<p>a. It shall be an offence for the operator of the DOLs to derive financial
or other material benefit from operating the online location.</p>
<p></p>
<p>b. Service providers [2] and digital advertising intermediaries [3] must
take reasonable steps to ensure that paid content that they include or
cause to be included on the DOLs are not communicated in Singapore.</p>
<p></p>
<p>c. Individuals [4] and companies must not provide financial support to
the DOLs if they know or have reason to believe that by doing so, they
will support, help, or promote the communication of falsehoods in Singapore
on the DOLs.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Members of the public are advised to be alert to Gutzy’s history of communicating
misinformation on these online locations, and to fact-check information
published at these DOLs.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<p>[1] See Annex for an explanation of when online locations are declared
as DOLs under POFMA.</p>
<p>[2] Examples include digital advertising agencies.</p>
<p>[3] Examples include advertising exchanges.</p>
<p>[4] This includes members of the public.</p>

<p><strong>Annex - Overview of POFMA “Declared Online Locations”</strong>
</p>
<p>1) Background on “Declared Online Locations”</p>
<p></p>
<p>• Under Section 32 of POFMA, an online location may be declared as a “Declared
Online Location” (“DOL”) if:</p>
<p>i. It has carried three or more different false statements of fact that
are the subject of active Part 3 or Part 4 Directions (e.g., POFMA Correction
Directions); and</p>
<p>ii. At least three of these false statements of fact had been communicated
on the online location within six months before the date of the Declaration.</p>
<p></p>
<p>• A notice must be published in the Government Gazette when a Declaration
is issued. A registry of DOLs can be found at the POFMA Office website.</p>
<p></p>
<p>• There are nine other online locations that are currently DOLs with effect
from 22 July 2023 up to 11 December 2025:</p>
<p>i. Mr Kenneth Jeyaretnam’s (“Mr Jeyaretnam’s”) Facebook page,</p>
<p>ii. Mr Jeyaretnam’s Instagram page,</p>
<p>iii. Mr Jeyaretnam’s LinkedIn page,</p>
<p>iv. Mr Jeyaretnam’s X (formerly known as Twitter) account page,</p>
<p>v. The Ricebowl Singapore website,</p>
<p>vi. The Online Citizen Asia’s (“TOCA’s”) website,</p>
<p>vii. TOCA’s Facebook page,</p>
<p>viii. TOCA’s LinkedIn page, and</p>
<p>ix. TOCA’s X account page.</p>
<p></p>
<p>• The owner or operator of a DOL, or any person with editorial control
over the DOL, may apply to the Minister for Communications and Information
to vary or cancel the declaration. If the Minister refuses the application,
an appeal can be made to the High Court.</p>
<p>2) Correction Directions issued to Gutzy</p>
<p>• Gutzy’s website, Facebook page and X account page have each met the
requirements to be declared as a DOL. Each of these online locations have
communicated at least three different false statements of fact in Singapore,
which are the subject of three active POFMA Correction Directions. Two
of the three active POFMA Correction Directions are in respect of five
false statements of fact which had first been communicated in February
2024.</p>
