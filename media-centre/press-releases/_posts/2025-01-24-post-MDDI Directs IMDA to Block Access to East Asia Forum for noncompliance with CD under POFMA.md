<p><strong>MDDI DIRECTS IMDA TO BLOCK ACCESS TO EAST ASIA FORUM FOR NON-COMPLIANCE WITH CORRECTION DIRECTION UNDER THE PROTECTION FROM ONLINE FALSEHOODS AND MANIPULATION ACT (POFMA)</strong>
</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The East Asia Forum has failed to comply with the Correction Direction
issued on 22 January 2025 to point out falsehoods in its article “Singapore’s
new prime minister entangled in old politics” (“<strong>the article</strong>”).
Consequently, the Minister for Digital Development and Information has
directed the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) to issue Access
Blocking Orders to require internet access service providers to disable
access for end-users in Singapore to East Asia Forum’s website, where the
falsehoods are communicated.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Correction Direction issued to East Asia Forum on 22 January 2025
had required the facts to be displayed along with the falsehoods, enabling
end-users in Singapore to read both versions and make their own judgements.
Despite three reminders sent to East Asia Forum to comply with the Correction
Direction, East Asia Forum has not complied (See <a href="/files/Press Releases 2025/Annex_Timeline.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Annex</a> for details).
Should East Asia Forum subsequently comply with the full requirements of
the Correction Direction, the Minister will cancel the Access Blocking
Orders.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Minister in the Prime Minister’s Office Ms Indranee Rajah has also
separately instructed POFMA Office to issue today, Targeted Correction
Directions<sup>1</sup> to Meta Platforms, Inc., LinkedIn Corporation, and
X Corp. This follows East Asia Forum’s failure to carry the Correction
Notice in its Facebook, LinkedIn, and X posts linking to the same article.
Meta Platforms, Inc., LinkedIn Corporation, and X Corp will be required
to communicate a correction notice to all end-users in Singapore who had
accessed, or will access, the posts.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the full facts of the case, please refer to the Factually article
“<a href="https://www.factually.gov.sg/corrections-and-clarifications/220125" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Corrections Regarding False Statements on the Misuse of Government Resources, Conduct of the Prosecution, and Rules of Obligations for Ministers</a>”.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Jointly issued by:</strong>
<br><strong>Ministry of Digital Development and Information</strong>
<br><strong>Prime Minister’s Office</strong>
</p>
<hr>
<p><sup>1</sup> A Targeted Correction Direction is a direction issued to an
Internet Intermediary (“II”) whose service was used to communicate a falsehood.
The direction requires the II to communicate a correction notice by means
of its service to all users in Singapore who access the falsehood through
its service. This is so that users who see the falsehood on a platform
also see the correction notice on that platform.&nbsp;</p>
