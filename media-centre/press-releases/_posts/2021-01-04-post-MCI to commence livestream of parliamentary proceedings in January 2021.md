1. The Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI) will commence the livestream of parliamentary proceedings in January 2021, with the first livestream taking place during the sitting on Monday 4 January 2021.  The livestream will be available to members of the public in real-time on MCI’s YouTube [\[https://go.gov.sg/mcisingapore\]](https://go.gov.sg/mcisingapore), in both the original and English-translated versions.   
 
 2. This follows the Minister for Communications and Information Mr S Iswaran’s speech in Parliament in September 2020 to wrap up the Debate on the President’s Address, where he mentioned the Government’s in-principle agreement to the livestreaming of parliamentary proceedings.   
 
 3. Prior to this, members of the public had already been provided full access to all parliamentary proceedings. These existing channels remain unchanged. Members of the public can watch proceedings in-person from the Strangers’ Gallery. Videos of every speech and exchange in Parliament are made available online on the CNA Parliament microsite. The full written record of parliamentary proceedings can also be viewed via the online Hansard at the parliament website.
