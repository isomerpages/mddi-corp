<p><strong>Launch of gov.sg - a single Sender ID for SMSes from the government</strong>
</p>
<p><em>This will be fully implemented across government agencies by 1 July 2024</em>
</p>
<p>1. The Singapore Government is introducing a new single SMS Sender ID, <strong>gov.sg</strong>,
to be used by all government agencies. From 1 July 2024, the public can
expect SMSes from government agencies to come from a single <strong>gov.sg</strong> SMS
Sender ID, instead of individual government agencies' Sender IDs. Using
a single SMS Sender ID will make it easier for the public to identify authentic
government communications sent by SMSes, and safeguard themselves against
government official impersonation scams.</p>
<p>2. The Government has partnered with SMS aggregators and all telecommunications
service providers, as well as their respective sub-brands operating in
Singapore, to safeguard the <strong>gov.sg</strong> Sender ID from being
spoofed.</p>
<p>3. Limited exceptions will be made for communications about National Service
matters and emergency services. Details of these limited exceptions can
be found in <strong><a href="/files/Press Releases 2024/Annex_A___Exceptions.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Annex A</a></strong>.</p>
<p>4. A non-exhaustive list of examples of government SMS communications
that will be sent through the <strong>gov.sg</strong> Sender ID can be found
in <strong><a href="/files/Press Releases 2024/Annex_B___List_of_Agencies.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Annex B</a></strong>.</p>
<p>5. SMS remains a key platform for government communications to the public
in Singapore, due to widespread adoption of mobile phones. Annually, over
100 million SMSes are sent by various government agencies<sup>1</sup> to
notify recipients of policy changes, provide transaction updates, and more.</p>
<p>6. <strong>Mr Sim Feng-Ji, Deputy Secretary (Smart Nation Group)</strong>,
said, “This consolidated <strong>gov.sg</strong> SMS Sender ID is designed
to give the public added confidence and ease of mind when it comes to identifying
legitimate SMSes from government agencies. It exemplifies the Government's
commitment in stamping out malicious attempts that undermine the public’s
trust in government communications.”</p>
<p>7. By 1 July 2024, identifying official communications from the government
will get easier, with government SMSes coming from a single <strong>gov.sg</strong> SMS
Sender ID. This will be progressively rolled out beginning from 18 June
2024, and members of the public are advised to continue remaining vigilant
against scams while checking for the official <strong>gov.sg</strong> Sender
ID in government SMSes.</p>
