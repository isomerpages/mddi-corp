</p>
<p><strong>Singapore, 27 June 2024</strong> – The inaugural Singapore-China
Digital Policy Dialogue (DPD) was held today in Beijing, China. Co-chaired
by Senior Minister of State for Communications and Information (MCI), Tan
Kiat How, and Head of National Data Administration of the People’s Republic
of China, Liu Liehong, the DPD gathered participants from Government, industry,
and academia to facilitate high-level discussions on developments and policy
matters in the digital domain.</p>

<p>Building on the existing multifaceted cooperation and robust economic
ties between Singapore and China, the first DPD sought to foster discussions
in two key areas:</p>
<p>(i) Advancing Singapore’s interests in trade and business facilitation
through <u>trusted commercial data flows</u>; and</p>

the cross-border flow of data, and to exchange knowledge on cross-border
data sharing mechanisms.</p>
<p></p>

<p>Both countries agreed on the establishment of the DPD when then-Prime

Republic of China Li Qiang in April 2023.</p>

of diplomatic ties in 1990, and bilateral cooperation between Singapore
and China has since grown in depth and scope<sup>1</sup>. China has been
Singapore’s largest merchandise trading partner while Singapore has been
China’s largest foreign investor since 2013 and we continue to make progress
in new areas of cooperation such as green development and the digital economy.</p>
