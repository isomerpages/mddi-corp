<p><strong>Summary of the Asia Tech x Singapore (ATxSG) Digital Forum of Small States (FOSS) Ministerial Dialogue on International Cooperation on Digital Governance and Digital Inclusivity by Chair and Minister for Communications and Information Mrs Josephine Teo, Thursday, 30 May 2024</strong>
</p>
<p>Sentosa, Singapore: Ministers, Ambassadors and senior government officials
from the Digital Forum of Small States (FOSS) met today at the ATxSummit
for a closed-door Government-to-Government dialogue on international cooperation
on digital governance and digital inclusivity (“Dialogue”). Minister for
Communications and Information and Second Minister for Home Affairs Mrs
Josephine Teo, who chaired the Dialogue, released the following Chair’s
Summary:&nbsp;</p>
<hr>
<p>“At the Digital FOSS Ministerial Dialogue on 30 May, we discussed the
challenges and opportunities for small states in a rapidly evolving and
increasingly sophisticated digital environment. There was broad consensus
that digital technology was an important enabler to catalyse change and
super-charge efforts towards achieving the United Nations’ Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs), and for small states, a multi-stakeholder approach
was crucial in addressing common challenges such as cybersecurity threats,
cross border data flows and the regulation of emerging technologies.”</p>
<p>On the <strong>governance of emerging technologies</strong>, the participants
recognised that artificial intelligence was a powerful emerging technology
that would benefit from a global, multi-stakeholder approach. In particular,
it was important to develop fit-for-purpose regulations, standards and
science-backed tools and techniques for AI governance. Collaboration across
public, private, people and academic sectors, as well as between countries
and regions, was crucial. The participants acknowledged the effort within
Digital FOSS to work on an AI Governance Playbook tailored to small states,
which would address the common challenges associated with the secure design,
development evaluation and implementation of AI systems.</p>
<p>On <strong>addressing the digital divide</strong>, the participants noted
that countries, and communities within countries, were at different levels
of digital development. It was important to strengthen efforts to enable
everyone to enjoy the fruits and benefits of digital technologies. A skills-focused
approach could help to equip people with the necessary capabilities to
navigate digital technologies, to enrich their daily lives, and to stay
safe online. Participants agreed that governments must take measures to
foster digital inclusion, and ensure that no one is left behind in the
digital age.</p>
<p>The participants agreed that this Dialogue was a useful opportunity to
bring together Digital FOSS members and strengthen mutual understanding
the circumstances and challenges faced by small states’ circumstances.
There was consensus that international cooperation was integral for Digital
FOSS members to share ideas and to contribute towards the closing of the
digital divide. In addition, we have to uphold multilateralism to enable
small states to survive and thrive in this digital age. The participants
agreed that these commonalities faced by small states should be addressed
in the Global Digital Compact which is currently being negotiated at the
United Nations.</p>
