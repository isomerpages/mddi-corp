<p>On June 5, 2024, U.S. Secretary of Commerce Raimondo and Singapore Minister
for Communications and Information Josephine Teo co-led a Roundtable on
Artificial Intelligence (AI) with U.S. and Singapore companies and government
officials. The Roundtable underscored the importance of the close and long-standing
relationship between the United States and Singapore, which has grown to
include close economic cooperation on digital issues.</p>
<p>This bilaterally coordinated fact sheet reflects the two countries’ shared
interest in deepening our cooperation in critical and emerging technologies
(CET). It provides an overview of shared principles and objectives related
to AI, as well as plans for future collaboration between the U.S. Department
of Commerce (Commerce) and Singapore’s Ministry of Communications and Information
(MCI).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We believe that the rise of AI, including generative AI, brings with it
new and developing opportunities, including the ability to enhance economic
and social welfare and digital inclusion, to accelerate and advance socially
beneficial research and scientific discovery, to support more competitive
and environmentally sustainable economic growth, and to promote fair and
competitive markets. Our two governments recognise the tremendous potential
of AI for good, including for the advancement of environmental sustainability,
education, and healthcare. Anchored by the extensive and robust economic
linkages between our countries, whereby nearly 6,000 U.S. companies currently
operate in Singapore and bilateral trade supports nearly 250,000 jobs across
the United States, our private sectors have also invested significantly
in AI. Technology spending in Singapore reached SGD 22 billion, the equivalent
of USD 16.3 billion in 2023, with the United States being the top foreign
investor. In recognition of this, U.S. companies’ existing and committed
capital investments in AI over the next few years, in partnership with
Singapore players in the local ecosystem, exceed SGD 50 billion (USD 37
billion). U.S. companies are making investments in Singapore’s local workforce,
infrastructure, and R&amp;D, including through establishing AI Centres
of Excellence in line with Singapore’s National AI Strategy 2.0. In addition,
companies on both sides have committed to partnering to raise the AI capabilities
of over 130,000 workers in Singapore, building on the strong support which
U.S. companies have already provided for the TechSkills Accelerator (TeSA),
Singapore’s national tech upskilling initiative.</p>
<p>At the same time, the United States and Singapore also recognise the need
to mitigate the challenges that come with the rapid, global proliferation
of AI. To fully realise AI’s benefits, Commerce and MCI have thus overseen
the development of new frameworks—the AI Risk Management Framework, developed
by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) at Commerce,
and AI Verify, developed by the Singapore Infocomm Media Development Authority
(IMDA) at MCI—for the safe, secure, and trustworthy development, deployment,
and evaluation of AI technologies; and the two sides have also completed
a mapping exercise between the two frameworks. Both sides recognise that
the testing and evaluation of AI technologies should take into account
trustworthiness considerations that can support the objectives of AI governance
frameworks. We believe AI governance should also take into consideration
relevant international standards and internationally recognised principles
and guidelines, including those on explainability, transparency, accountability,
fairness, inclusivity, robustness, reproducibility, security, safety, data
governance, human-AI configuration, inclusive growth, and societal and
environmental well-being. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Commerce and MCI intend to continue cooperating on AI to advance an inclusive
and forward-looking agenda for economic growth and to boost AI competitiveness
for both the United States and Singapore. To this end:&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NIST and IMDA will continue to cooperate
through the exchange of best practices and other information concerning
AI governance frameworks, including the NIST AI Risk Management Framework
and IMDA’s AI Verify. NIST and IMDA intend to continue collaboration to
address the next generation of AI, including mapping our respective frameworks
for generative AI, exploring cooperation on testing, guidelines, and benchmarks,
and engaging the broader community where appropriate. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The U.S. AI Safety Institute, housed
within NIST, and Singapore’s Digital Trust Centre, its AI Safety Institute
funded by IMDA and National Research Foundation, Singapore, are planning
important collaborations on advancing the science of AI safety, which will
operate as a crucial linkage in a global network of AI safety institutes
and other government-supported scientific institutions. &nbsp;</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Commerce and MCI will also engage
in collaborative activities that support the responsible design, development,
deployment, and evaluation of AI technologies alongside the encouragement
of commercialisation opportunities, development of international standards,
research cooperation, workforce development, and industry cooperation.
&nbsp;</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, Commerce and IMDA are announcing
they will also seek to launch a new AI Talent Bridge programme. This initiative
expands on the U.S.-Singapore Women in Tech Partnership Program launched
by Secretary Raimondo and Minister Teo in 2022. In the months ahead, it
will deepen collaboration between the United States and Singapore on critical
emerging technology, including AI, with an emphasis on supporting youth,
women, and future leaders in tech.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>The strong cooperation on AI between Commerce and MCI is designed to complement
and build on ongoing work in other bilateral platforms, such as the U.S.-Singapore
Partnership for Growth and Innovation established by Commerce and Singapore’s
Ministry of Trade and Industry, as well as the AI Governance Group established
under the U.S.-Singapore CET Dialogue. It also ties in with efforts to
develop a bilateral Roadmap for Digital Economic Cooperation, as announced
under the U.S.-Singapore CET Dialogue, which will include AI among other
priority areas. We seek to share our learnings and best practices from
these bilateral efforts with other partners in the region, and to lend
appropriate support for broader efforts through our AI governance work
with international standards bodies, the ASEAN AI Roadmap, and the ASEAN
Guide on AI Governance and Ethics, endorsed during Singapore’s ASEAN Digital
Chairmanship this year.</p>
