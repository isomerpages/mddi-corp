<p><strong>SMART NATION 2.0 VISION TO ENSURE A THRIVING DIGITAL FUTURE FOR ALL</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Singapore, 1 October 2024 – </strong>Prime Minister and Minister
for Finance Lawrence Wong today announced Smart Nation 2.0, Singapore’s
refreshed vision for a society where everyone can thrive in the digital
age. Smart Nation 2.0 focuses on three goals of Trust, Growth, and Community
to guide our efforts to improve citizens’ lives and respond to digital
trends and developments.</p>
<p>2. The announcement was made at the launch of Smart Nation 2.0, which
was attended by around 200 guests, including partners from the industry,
academia, community, and volunteers. Special guests included Senior Minister
Lee Hsien Loong, Senior Minister and Coordinating Minister for National
Security Teo Chee Hean, and Minister for Digital Development and Information
Josephine Teo. The event was also attended by Minister for Foreign Affairs
Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, Senior Minister of State (SMS) for Digital Development
and Information Janil Puthucheary, SMS for Digital Development and Information
Tan Kiat How, and Minister of State for Digital Development and Information
Rahayu Mahzam. The event was held at the Punggol Digital District, Singapore’s
first smart and sustainable business district where the seamless integration
of smart infrastructure, digital innovation, and green spaces redefines
our day-to-day work and living.</p>
<p><strong>Smart Nation 2.0</strong>
</p>
<p>3. In 2014, the Smart Nation initiative was announced by then-Prime Minister
Lee Hsien Loong as a vision to build better, more meaningful, and fulfilled
lives for our people, enabled by technology. Since then, we have made significant
progress. We have invested heavily in our digital economy, society, government,
and security. We have also used digital technologies to raise citizens’
quality of life across domains, ranging healthcare, education, and infrastructure.
These efforts have helped establish important foundations to build our
Smart Nation 2.0 upon.</p>
<p>4.<strong> </strong>Digital technologies have now become an integral and
pervasive part of our lives, influencing how we live, work, and play. Technology
holds tremendous promise for Singapore and we must maximise opportunities
for our citizens. At the same time, we must continuously address emerging
challenges that have arisen, such as threats to social cohesion, livelihoods,
safety, and wellbeing.</p>
<p>5. Ten years on, we are refreshing our Smart Nation aspirations for the
road ahead. Improving citizens’ lives and harnessing technology as a force
for good will <strong>remain at the heart</strong> of our Smart Nation efforts. <strong>But we need to go beyond a narrow focus on digitalisation</strong>.
We must carefully examine the impact of technology on our humanity and
society. We must shape and direct digital developments towards outcomes
that benefit Singaporeans. We must always be guided by the need to uphold
our shared values as a nation to move forward together.</p>
<p>6. Smart Nation 2.0 therefore seeks to achieve three key goals: <strong>Trust, Growth, and Community</strong>.
These goals will serve as a compass, shaping how we use technology to improve
citizens’ lives and create a thriving digital future for all. These goals
also reflect key areas of feedback and concern that citizens have raised
over the years, gathered through the government’s feedback channels, surveys,
research, and engagements, such as the Forward Singapore (Forward SG) exercise.
The <strong>key moves under each goal</strong> are highlighted below.</p>
<p><em>(i) <u>Trust</u></em>
</p>
<p>7. While digital technologies can enrich our lives, issues like disruptions
to our digital services and the proliferation of online harms like scams
can cause distress and exacerbate risks to our financial, mental, and even
physical wellbeing. To build a Smart Nation that we can trust, we aim to <strong>(i) enhance the security and resilience of our digital infrastructure, (ii) strengthen our fight against harmful online activities, and (iii) expand our trusted digital spaces together as a society</strong>.</p>
<p>8. We have worked over the years to build a Smart Nation that is safe,
reliable, and secure. For example, we enhanced the Cybersecurity Act in
2024 to regulate a broader range of organisations and systems that we increasingly
rely on, such as cloud services and data centres. In the next bound of
our Smart Nation journey, we will bolster our efforts to improve the reliability
of our digital infrastructure and services. We are intending to introduce
a new Digital Infrastructure Act in 2025 to address a broader set of resilience
and security risks.</p>
<p>9. To enhance online safety and provide stronger assurance to victims
of online harms, we will set up <strong>a new agency for online safety and assurance, backed by a new law to improve protection for victims of online harms. </strong>The
agency will act on behalf of victims to direct perpetrators and online
service providers to put a stop to the online harm quickly, providing added
assurance on top of existing regulatory levers and court-based processes
available today. We will focus on the most serious and prevalent online
harms affecting victims in Singapore, such as cyberbullying and the non-consensual
sharing of intimate images.</p>
<p><em>(ii) <u>Growth</u></em>
</p>
<p>10. We will make every effort to help our workers and businesses adapt,
prepare, and reap the benefits of digitalisation. To build a Smart Nation
that helps us grow, we will <strong>(i) power our digital economy, (ii) empower our enterprises and workers, and (iii) prepare our next generation for life in a digital future</strong>.</p>
<p>11. We launched the National Artificial Intelligence (AI) Strategy 2.0
in 2023 to empower our people and economy to reap the opportunities AI
presents. Since then, we have seen greater AI adoption and innovation across
our government, economy, and society. We will add to our investments in
using AI to push the limits of scientific discovery, with an additional <strong>S$120 million investment in “AI for Science”.</strong>
</p>
<p>12. To prepare our next generation to become curious, confident, and creative
users of technology and help them realise their aspirations in a digital
world, we will enhance programmes, increase resources for schools, and
strengthen support for educators to design effective learning experiences
that develop students’ digital proficiency.</p>
<p>a) <strong>We will launch a new Smart Nation Educator Fellowship in 2025. </strong>The
six-month<sup>1</sup> Fellowship programme will help Senior Specialists
and Teacher Leaders<sup>2</sup> better understand the latest digital issues,
offering them practical insights on the real-world applications of technology.
Educators can then translate the knowledge and skills they acquired from
the Fellowship into curriculum design or effective teaching and learning
strategies which they can share with other educators.</p>
<p>b) <strong>Starting from 2025, we will introduce new “AI for Fun” modules.</strong> These
five to 10-hour elective modules are available under the Code for Fun programme<sup>3</sup>,
which all Ministry of Education primary and secondary schools can offer.
These new modules will offer students further opportunities for hands-on
exploration and tinkering with technology, such as through the design of
prototypes incorporating AI.</p>
<p><em>(iii) <u>Community</u></em>
</p>
<p>13. As Singapore navigates the digital age, we must ensure that our Smart
Nation efforts benefit and uplift all segments of society. We must uphold
our shared values and aspirations, deepen our care for the people around
us, and preserve our sense of togetherness. To build a Smart Nation that
keeps us together, we will <strong>(i) strengthen digital inclusion, leaving no one behind, (ii) use technology to help strengthen the unity of our people, and (iii) use technology to strengthen the government’s partnerships with citizens</strong>.</p>
<p>14. Today, some Singaporeans still find technology daunting. We will strengthen
our outreach efforts and partnerships to reach more citizens and help them
learn digital skills with confidence. For example, we will develop more
courses on digital skills for everyday living and reach more citizens at
their workplaces. We will continue to keep key physical services available
for those who are unable to use digital channels.</p>
<p>15. Technology can also be used to expand common spaces for us to connect
with our culture, heritage, and fellow Singaporeans. We have already employed
digital tools to bring the community together, such as platforms that allow
Singaporeans to raise funds for those in need. We will continue to launch
and support more initiatives that reimagine and reinvigorate how we connect
with one another and our culture through technology. For example, the National
Library Board recently developed a new generative AI-powered prototype
chat service, ChatBook, where users can ‘converse’ with a book and learn
more about our history.</p>
<p><strong>Smart Nation 2.0: A Whole-of-Nation Movement</strong>
</p>
<p>16. We will refine and adapt our strategies and approaches in close consultation
with citizens and businesses, responding to advancements in technology
and emerging challenges. The goals of Trust, Growth, and Community will
guide our responses to digital developments, even as our strategies evolve.
Smart Nation 2.0 is a whole-of-nation movement, with every Singaporean
and stakeholder contributing towards building a thriving digital future
for all.</p>

<hr>
<p><sup>1</sup>The programme duration, inclusive of optional modules, will
be capped at 80 hours.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>Senior Specialists help to shape the national curriculum.
Teacher Leaders include Master Teachers, Senior Teachers, and Lead Teachers.
They play an important role in championing professional development and
pedagogical excellence among the teaching fraternity.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>Since 2020, the Code for Fun Programme (CFF), or a comparable
coding programme, has been mandatory for all upper primary students. While
CFF remains an optional programme at the secondary school level, almost
two thirds of secondary schools offered the programme in 2023.
