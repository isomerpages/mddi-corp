<p><strong>Second U.S.-Singapore Critical and Emerging Technology Dialogue: Joint Fact Sheet</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>31 July 2024</strong>
</p>
<p>Today, Singapore Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr. Vivian Balakrishnan,
Singapore Minister for Digital Development and Information Josephine Teo,
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, and U.S. National Security Advisor
Jake Sullivan chaired the second U.S.-Singapore Critical and Emerging Technology
(CET) Dialogue in Singapore. Building on the inaugural U.S.-Singapore CET
Dialogue held in Washington. D.C. in October 2023, Singapore and the United
States reaffirmed our commitment to building trusted, open, accessible,
and secure technology ecosystems to promote responsible innovation, inclusive
and sustainable economic growth, and a rules-based international order.</p>
<p>During the Dialogue, the co-chairs noted the substantial progress made
in deepening linkages and collaboration across our business, scientific,
and national security communities. They reviewed our ongoing areas of cooperation
and discussed ways to further bridge our innovation ecosystems to deliver
a brighter future for the U.S. and Singaporean peoples as well as our partners
in ASEAN and across the Indo-Pacific region. This includes making progress
to negotiate and conclude an Agreement on Science and Technology Cooperation
between Singapore and the United States to strengthen scientific and technological
capabilities and promote scientific and technological cooperation in areas
of mutual benefit for peaceful purposes.</p>
<p>The co-chairs welcomed the substantive steps forward that both sides have
taken – as friends and strategic partners – in advancing cooperation in
the six main areas under the Dialogue as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Expanding the mapping of the U.S. Department of Commerce’s National Institute
of Standards and Technology (NIST) and Singapore Infocomm Media Development
Authority (IMDA)’s respective governance and risk management frameworks
to include generative AI.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Collaborating on testing and evaluation between NIST and IMDA, such as
exploring the alignment of red-teaming guidelines and benchmarks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cooperating to support the development of international standards, frameworks,
best practices, and guidelines for AI at international standards developing
bodies such as the International Organization for Standardization that
promote interoperability, resilience, safety and security, and public good.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Welcoming cooperation between the United States’ and Singapore’s AI Safety
Institutes to advance the science of AI safety. Our AI scientists will
meet in September 2024 to exchange insights and identify concrete projects
on AI testing and evaluation, as well as safe and secure AI model development.
This cooperation will be a crucial linkage in an emerging international
network of AI Safety Institutes and other government-supported scientific
institutions. The United States and Singapore will work together to support
the forthcoming convening of the international network of AI Safety Institutes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Exploring research collaboration between the National Science Foundation
(NSF) and AI Singapore (AISG) through grant calls on responsible AI.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Supporting the inclusive and sustainable development of AI through a capacity-building
program under the U.S.-Singapore Third Country Training Program for officials
from Southeast Asia.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Convening an NSF-funded workshop in Singapore to facilitate discussions
on enhancing collaboration in responsible AI research between the United
States and South and Southeast Asian partners.</p>
</li>
</ul>
