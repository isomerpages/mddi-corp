<p><strong>CENTRE FOR ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES IN ONLINE SAFETY (CATOS) TO RECEIVE S$50 MILLION IN FUNDING TO ENHANCE ONLINE TRUST AND SAFETY IN SINGAPORE</strong>
</p>
<p><em>This sum includes a S$30 million boost, which supplements the initial S$20 million that was announced by the Government in January 2024</em>
</p>
<p><strong>SINGAPORE, 15 MAY 2024</strong> – The Centre for Advanced Technologies
in Online Safety (CATOS) was officially launched by Mrs Josephine Teo,
Minister for Communications and Information &amp; Minister-in-charge of
Smart Nation and Cybersecurity, at the inaugural Online Trust &amp; Safety
(OTS) Forum on 15 May 2024. CATOS will receive <strong>an additional S$30 million investment from the National Research Foundation, Singapore (NRF)</strong> to
boost its ability to enhance online trust and safety in Singapore, <strong>supplementing the initial S$20 million funding</strong> announced
in January 2024 to set up CATOS.</p>
<p>2. Speaking at the inaugural OTS Forum, Minister Josephine Teo announced
that CATOS will receive a total of S$50 million in funding over five years
under the Smart Nation and Digital Economy domain of Singapore’s Research,
Innovation and Enterprise 2025 Plan. This is in line with <strong>Singapore’s commitment to advancing online trust and safety and building a safer online ecosystem for Singapore users</strong>.</p>
<p>3. Hosted by the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR),
CATOS was set up to strengthen Singapore’s overall capacity to monitor
and tackle the growing array of harms in the online space, including online
discrimination and hate speech, misinformation and disinformation, and
AI-generated harms such as deepfakes. Since its inception, CATOS has been
working with a wide range of partners from diverse sectors, encompassing
government, industry, academia, and civil society, to develop and deploy
advanced technological solutions to address online harms, including those
which are unique to Singapore. The technological solutions developed by
CATOS will complement existing regulatory efforts and ground-up initiatives
to build a safer online ecosystem for Singapore users.</p>
<p><strong><u>Advancing Our Pursuit of Online Trust and Safety</u></strong>
</p>
<p>4. The additional S$30 million investment will primarily support the following
new initiatives by CATOS:</p>
<p>a) <strong>Developing new technological capabilities to detect online harms that can be harmful to individuals and our society. This includes online hate, discrimination, harm to health and well-being, and threats to personal and community safety. </strong>CATOS
will develop advanced technologies to identify and detect online content
that is unhealthy or unsafe, or that contains hate or discrimination, which
could undermine our racial and religious harmony.</p>
<p>b) <strong>Continuing investment in research to stay ahead of evolving challenges in the OTS space. </strong>The
online space evolves rapidly, and our ability to respond must not fall
behind. CATOS will seek to foster innovation and attract talent through
a range of initiatives. This includes issuing open calls for research proposals
to solicit high-quality proposals and ideas, to address emerging problems
and threats in the OTS space. CATOS will also engage the community through
various initiatives, such as hackathons and innovation challenges.</p>
<p>c) <strong>Establishing a sandbox environment to test and refine new technologies aimed at combating online harms while safeguarding the integrity and security of online platforms. </strong>The
CATOS sandbox will provide developers with a controlled virtual space to
testbed solutions to address various harms online. This sandbox will facilitate
rapid experimentation of new technologies in real-world scenarios, without
compromising the underlying operational environment. For solutions that
have been proven to be effective, CATOS will work with developers to facilitate
their deployment through licensing or service agreements.</p>
<p>5. Enhancing online trust and safety requires a collaborative approach,
and CATOS has been actively fostering collaborations with key stakeholders
in the OTS ecosystem. At this forum, CATOS announced the signing of a Memorandum
of Understanding (MoU) with Adobe to explore the implementation of content
provenance technologies in Singapore. The MoU aims to enhance the authenticity
of digital content by providing a way to help ensure its authenticity and
reliability via tracing its origin. This is part of CATOS’ work on developing
plug-ins and software solutions to make it more seamless to include content
provenance in publishing articles or images.</p>
<p>6. To mitigate the spread of misinformation, CATOS also works with community
partners like CheckMate, a ground-up, volunteer-driven initiative aimed
at countering misinformation and scams propagated via private messaging
channels.</p>
<p>CheckMate has built a system where users can forward dubious information
to a WhatsApp number and receive checks in response. CATOS will partner
CheckMate to explore tools that can help their volunteers fact-check more
quickly and effectively, such as CATOS’ in-house fact-checking technologies.
This will help CheckMate better combat misinformation and its associated
harms.</p>
<p>7. Dr Yang Yinping, Centre Director for CATOS said, “The Online Trust
and Safety landscape faces rapidly evolving threats, and it is critical
for us to have innovative solutions to stay ahead. An ecosystem approach
is needed, and CATOS will work closely with our partners from academia,
industry, the public sector, and non-governmental organisations to develop
advanced technological solutions that will contribute to realising Singapore’s
vision for a safer online space for all.”</p>
<p>8. Organised by CATOS, the one-day OTS Forum brought together more than
250 local and international OTS experts and thought leaders in policy,
education, and technology to exchange experiences and insights on the latest
trends and developments in online trust and safety.</p>
