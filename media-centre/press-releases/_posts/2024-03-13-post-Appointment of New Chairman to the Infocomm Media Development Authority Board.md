<p>2. Mr Chan, who is also Permanent Secretary (Health), was the Chief Executive
Officer (CEO) of Infocomm Development Authority (IDA) from January 2005
to November 2007 and Permanent Secretary (Information, Communications and
the Arts) from January 2008 to November 2012. He took over as Chairman
of the IDA Board in November 2015. Mr Chan oversaw the merger of IDA and
the Media Development Authority (MDA) to form IMDA in 2016, and continued
to steward IMDA as Chairman of the IMDA Board thereafter. Mr Chan led the
development of the Intelligent Nation 2015 (iN2015) Masterplan during his
tenure as CEO and Permanent Secretary, including the roll-out of Singapore’s
fibre-to-the-home Nationwide Broadband Network (NBN). These provided the
foundation to help Singapore realise its Smart Nation vision. IDA launched
the Infocomm Media 2025 (ICM 2025) Masterplan in 2015, which IMDA has implemented
under Mr Chan’s chairmanship.</p>

<p>3. With Mr Chan’s guidance, IMDA has continued to architect Singapore’s
Digital Future. It has been rolling out future-ready digital infrastructure
from 5G standalone wireless networks to upgrading the wired NBN for seamless
10Gbps access on broadband, digitalising enterprises at scale through SMEs
Go Digital and CTO-as-a-Service, and anchoring a local core of globally
competitive digital workforce with in-demand industry- relevant skills,
such as via TechSkills Accelerator (TeSA). Mr Chan also led IMDA to punch
above its weight on the global stage, in both the tech and media realms.
Asia Tech x Singapore (ATxSG) has been convening policy makers and thought
leaders for frank discussions on the challenges and opportunities of the
latest tech trends. The Singapore Media Festival showcases Made-with-Singapore
creations to the world; many of these are the result of IMDA’s development
of local media enterprises and talent. On the domestic front, Mr Chan guided
IMDA to build a safe and inclusive Digital Society, growing from direct
outreach to seniors to bringing on board people and private sector partners
with the Digital for Life national movement.</p>
<p>4. The incoming Chairman Mr Russell Tham is not new to IMDA, having served
as a Member of the IMDA Board since 1 October 2020. He has also served
as the Chairperson of IMDA's Technology Sub-Committee since 1 April 2023.
With Mr Tham’s experience and expertise, he has been instrumental in advising
IMDA on new and emerging digital technologies, the translation of these
technologies for business adoption, as well as potential policy implications.</p>
<p>5. The Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI) and IMDA are deeply
appreciative of Mr Chan’s unwavering commitment and leadership of IMDA
over the past two decades. We look forward to Mr Tham’s continued guidance
and leadership of IMDA in the coming years.</p>
