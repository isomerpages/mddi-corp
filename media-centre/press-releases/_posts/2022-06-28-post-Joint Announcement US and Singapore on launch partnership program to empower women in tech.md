1. WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina M. Raimondo and Singapore’s Minister for Communications and Information Josephine Teo announced the launch of the U.S.-Singapore Women in Tech Partnership Program, a platform for budding and experienced women tech leaders from Singapore and the United States to establish new international contacts and networks. The program will debut as part of the 2022 SelectUSA Investment Summit in National Harbor, Maryland.

2. Program participants will benefit from learning opportunities through networking and mentoring sessions, workshops, and other activities that facilitate partnerships between companies for in-market expansion. These engagements will enable cross-pollination of ideas and provide greater support for women entrepreneurs exploring business opportunities overseas.

3. Secretary Raimondo and Minister Teo officially announced the Program during a panel discussion with Singaporean women business leaders on ways governments can help support women tech entrepreneurs and amplify efforts to attract and develop women professionals in tech.

4. “Through this program, women tech entrepreneurs in both the U.S. and Singapore will have a unique forum to learn from each other, understand the dynamics of each country’s respective markets, and collaborate on new ventures,” said Secretary Raimondo. “Helping women-owned companies grow and succeed is a passion I share with Minister Teo, and we look forward to helping these women entrepreneurs make big and bold business moves from both sides of our world.”

5. Minister Teo stated, “Women can play a leading part in building vibrant and sustainable digital economies. Strengthening collaboration between Singapore and the U.S. to support women in their journeys as tech leaders and entrepreneurs has been a shared passion between Secretary Raimondo and me. The launch of this partnership reflects our commitment to turn ideas into action that benefit women in tech. It will broaden their networks and create new opportunities for scaling their businesses internationally.”

6. The Partnership Program is part of broader bilateral collaboration under the U.S.-Singapore Partnership for Growth and Innovation’s (PGI) digital economy pillar. A Memorandum of Understanding implementing the PGI was signed by Raimondo and Singapore’s Minister for Trade and Industry Gan Kim Yong in October 2021. The PGI is a bilateral economic cooperation platform designed to secure inclusive growth for our economies and region by strengthening U.S.-Singapore opportunities and collaboration in new and forward-looking areas.
