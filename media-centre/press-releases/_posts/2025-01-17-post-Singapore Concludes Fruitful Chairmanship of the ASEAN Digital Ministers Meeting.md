<p><strong>Singapore Concludes Fruitful Chairmanship of the ASEAN Digital Ministers Meeting, Delivering Concrete Outcomes to Bring ASEAN Towards a Brighter Digital Future</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Singapore, as the Chair of the 4th ASEAN Digital Ministers Meeting (ADGMIN),
has handed over the Chairmanship to Thailand, after a year that saw deepening
cooperation and significant progress among ASEAN Member States (AMS) in
digital priorities critical to their citizens and businesses.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Under Singapore’s Chairmanship, AMS strengthened cooperation in AI governance
and safety, cybersecurity, combatting scams, and cross-border data flows.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Singapore’s Minister of Digital Development and Information, Mrs. Josephine
Teo, attended the 5th ADGMIN in Thailand on 16 to 17 January 2025, where
she officially handed over the ADGMIN Chairmanship to Mr. Prasert Jantararuangtong,
Thailand’s Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Digital Economy and Society.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Minister Teo said: “Singapore is immensely grateful for the strong support
of ASEAN Member States (AMS) during our Chairmanship. Together, we made
significant strides towards many of our digital priorities for the benefit
of our peoples and businesses. We wish Thailand every success in its Chairmanship.
Singapore remains firmly committed to advancing Tech for the Public Good
for ASEAN and the world. We will continue working with AMS to transform
our region into a digitally connected economic and social bloc, undergirded
by robust cybersecurity efforts.”</p>

<p><strong>Milestones Achieved under Singapore’s Chairmanship</strong>
</p>
<ol start="5" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The 4th ADGMIN, held in Singapore in February 2024, brought together delegates
from all 10 AMS, Dialogue Partners – US, China, Japan, Korea and India
– as well as the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) as Development
Partner.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Following the four-day event, AMS pressed on with their efforts to forge
a more integrated, open, safe and resilient digital ASEAN over the past
year. The past year’s advancements in overcoming transboundary digital
challenges hinges upon close cooperation within ASEAN, with Singapore taking
an active, leading role.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>AI Governance</strong>
</p>
<ol start="7" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Under its Chairmanship, Singapore continued to lead and shape AI Governance
discussions in ASEAN through the Working Group on AI Governance (WG-AI),
which Singapore established and convened. The WG-AI is now tasked to oversee
and coordinate all AI work in ASEAN. The Working Group also serves as the
focal point for ASEAN’s cooperation on AI with external partners like the
US, China, Japan, Korea and India.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The WG-AI built on the ASEAN Guide on AI Governance and Ethics launched
in 2024 and expanded its scope to address the governance of Generative
AI. The Expanded Guide took reference from IMDA’s MGF-Gen AI, and was adapted
for ASEAN’s context. It features use cases from ASEAN that exemplify how
organisations in our region are approaching some of the practical challenges
of AI governance and ethics, including from: Project Moonshot by AI Verify
Foundation (Singapore), PhoGPT by VinAI (Viet Nam), and ThaiLLM by the
Big Data Institute (Thailand).</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The WG-AI will now look into driving some of the key recommendations of
the Guide, such as developing common safety benchmarks and a regional testing
framework.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Singapore’s efforts in the WG-AI ensure that we continue to play an active
role in AI governance in the region and that our businesses’ and citizens’
interests are well-represented. With the development of practical guides,
common benchmarks and frameworks, public trust that undergirds AI innovation
can be strengthened. Such initiatives also facilitate the scaling of businesses
not just within their home country, but in the region.</p>
</li>

<p></p>
<p><strong>Cybersecurity</strong>
</p>
<p><u>ASEAN Regional CERT</u>
</p>
<ol start="11" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Following the endorsement of the financial model of the ASEAN Regional
during the 4th ADGMIN, its inaugural taskforce meeting - chaired by Malaysia
as the first rotating overall coordinator – took place in Singapore on
16 August 2024. This marked a significant milestone in ASEAN, in strengthening
the region’s cyber-response capabilities to address common threats.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Located in Singapore, the physical facility of the ASEAN Regional CERT
will allow all ASEAN Member States to more actively participate in the
timely sharing of information on cyber-related threats through CERT-CERT
cooperation. The facility also provides dedicated space for activities
(e.g. cyber exercises,</p>
<p>workshops, and CERT-CERT cyber capacity building programmes) that will
foster a cohesive collaboration of efforts under the initiative.</p>
