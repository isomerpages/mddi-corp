<p><strong>Singapore Concludes Fruitful Chairmanship of the ASEAN Digital Ministers Meeting, Delivering Concrete Outcomes to Bring ASEAN Towards a Brighter Digital Future</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Singapore, as the Chair of the 4th ASEAN Digital Ministers Meeting (ADGMIN),
has handed over the Chairmanship to Thailand, after a year that saw deepening
cooperation and significant progress among ASEAN Member States (AMS) in
digital priorities critical to their citizens and businesses.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Under Singapore’s Chairmanship, AMS strengthened cooperation in AI governance
and safety, cybersecurity, combatting scams, and cross-border data flows.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Singapore’s Minister of Digital Development and Information, Mrs. Josephine
Teo, attended the 5th ADGMIN in Thailand on 16 to 17 January 2025, where
she officially handed over the ADGMIN Chairmanship to Mr. Prasert Jantararuangtong,
Thailand’s Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Digital Economy and Society.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Minister Teo said: “Singapore is immensely grateful for the strong support
of ASEAN Member States (AMS) during our Chairmanship. Together, we made
significant strides towards many of our digital priorities for the benefit
of our peoples and businesses. We wish Thailand every success in its Chairmanship.
Singapore remains firmly committed to advancing Tech for the Public Good
for ASEAN and the world. We will continue working with AMS to transform
our region into a digitally connected economic and social bloc, undergirded
by robust cybersecurity efforts.”</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Milestones Achieved under Singapore’s Chairmanship</strong>
</p>
<ol start="5" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The 4th ADGMIN, held in Singapore in February 2024, brought together delegates
from all 10 AMS, Dialogue Partners – US, China, Japan, Korea and India
– as well as the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) as Development
Partner.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Following the four-day event, AMS pressed on with their efforts to forge
a more integrated, open, safe and resilient digital ASEAN over the past
year. The past year’s advancements in overcoming transboundary digital
challenges hinges upon close cooperation within ASEAN, with Singapore taking
an active, leading role.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>AI Governance</strong>
</p>
<ol start="7" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Under its Chairmanship, Singapore continued to lead and shape AI Governance
discussions in ASEAN through the Working Group on AI Governance (WG-AI),
which Singapore established and convened. The WG-AI is now tasked to oversee
and coordinate all AI work in ASEAN. The Working Group also serves as the
focal point for ASEAN’s cooperation on AI with external partners like the
US, China, Japan, Korea and India.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The WG-AI built on the ASEAN Guide on AI Governance and Ethics launched
in 2024 and expanded its scope to address the governance of Generative
AI. The Expanded Guide took reference from IMDA’s MGF-Gen AI, and was adapted
for ASEAN’s context. It features use cases from ASEAN that exemplify how
organisations in our region are approaching some of the practical challenges
of AI governance and ethics, including from: Project Moonshot by AI Verify
Foundation (Singapore), PhoGPT by VinAI (Viet Nam), and ThaiLLM by the
Big Data Institute (Thailand).</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The WG-AI will now look into driving some of the key recommendations of
the Guide, such as developing common safety benchmarks and a regional testing
framework.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Singapore’s efforts in the WG-AI ensure that we continue to play an active
role in AI governance in the region and that our businesses’ and citizens’
interests are well-represented. With the development of practical guides,
common benchmarks and frameworks, public trust that undergirds AI innovation
can be strengthened. Such initiatives also facilitate the scaling of businesses
not just within their home country, but in the region.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Cybersecurity</strong>
</p>
<p><u>ASEAN Regional CERT</u>
</p>
<ol start="11" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Following the endorsement of the financial model of the ASEAN Regional
during the 4th ADGMIN, its inaugural taskforce meeting - chaired by Malaysia
as the first rotating overall coordinator – took place in Singapore on
16 August 2024. This marked a significant milestone in ASEAN, in strengthening
the region’s cyber-response capabilities to address common threats.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Located in Singapore, the physical facility of the ASEAN Regional CERT
will allow all ASEAN Member States to more actively participate in the
timely sharing of information on cyber-related threats through CERT-CERT
cooperation. The facility also provides dedicated space for activities
(e.g. cyber exercises, workshops, and CERT-CERT cyber capacity building
programmes) that will foster a cohesive collaboration of efforts under
the initiative.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As cybersecurity threats are transboundary in nature, the establishment
of the ASEAN Regional CERT is expected to be beneficial to fortifying Singapore’s
own defences against cyber threats.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<p><u>ASEAN Checklist for the Implementation of the Norms of Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace</u>
</p>
<ol start="14" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Singapore and Malaysia, as co-leads, worked closely with all AMS to drive
the development of the ASEAN Checklist for the Implementation of the Norms
of Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace, making ASEAN the first region
to develop such a resource. The Checklist serves as a reference for States
to take practical steps towards building capacity to implement the voluntary,
non-binding norms of responsible State behaviour in cyberspace, as contained
in the 2015 UN Report of the Group of Governmental Experts on developments
in the field of information and telecommunications in the context of international
security, in line with our national priorities and capacities.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Taken together, the efforts of the ASEAN Regional CERT and Checklist contribute
towards an open, safe, secure, stable, accessible, interoperable, and peaceful
cyberspace, which underpins ASEAN’s growing digital economy. The Checklist
is not only useful for AMS, but also for countries beyond the region to
support the collective efforts to build a safer and more secure cyberspace.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Combatting Scams</strong>
</p>
<ol start="16" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>A Working Group on Anti-Online Scams was established and convened to strengthen
the ways ASEAN can combat scams across digital and telecommunication channels
during Singapore’s chairmanship. As Chair of the 4th ADGMIN, Singapore
strongly supported Thailand in securing the endorsement of AMS on two key
outcome documents, namely: Report of the Online Scams Activities in ASEAN,
and ASEAN Recommendations on Anti-Online Scams.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To maintain the momentum, Singapore will be developing the ASEAN Guide
for Anti-Scams Policies and Best Practices in 2025. This Guide will establish
recommended anti-scam policies and best practices for combating scam calls
and text messages. The Guide will also explore a region-wide information-sharing
arrangement, which can help facilitate cross-border tracing of scams in
telco channels. Singapore will also share some of the best practices from
governments in the region, including our multi-layered approach to disrupt
the scammers’ kill-chain.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recognising the transboundary nature of scams, these guidelines and combined
efforts between government and industry within the region will raise the
barriers for scammers attempting to establish operations in ASEAN, creating
stronger protection for AMS citizens against scams.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Cross-border data flows to facilitate business operations</strong>
</p>
<ol start="19" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>In recognition of the challenges that businesses face in navigating different
data protection regimes within ASEAN and globally, Singapore initiated
several initiatives to promote trusted flow of data across borders. These
initiatives include the ASEAN Guide on Data Anonymisation, Operational
Framework for Global Cross-border Privacy Rules, and Joint Guide to ASEAN
Model Contractual Clauses (MCCs) and Ibero-American Data Protection Network
(RIPD) MCCs. We welcome cooperation with external partners on such efforts
and will be working with China to develop a Joint Guide on Mapping of the
ASEAN MCCs and China’s Standard Contractual Clauses for Cross-border Data
Flows this year.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These initiatives help bring clarity to businesses on the cross-border
mechanisms and processes and lower operational costs for businesses, which
may face challenges in navigating different data protection regimes in
ASEAN and globally. This is especially important for a regional business
hub such as Singapore.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Singapore’s Winners at the ASEAN Digital Awards</strong>
</p>
<ol start="21" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The annual award ceremony for the ASEAN Digital Awards (ADA) was held
in conjunction with the 5th ADGMIN Gala Dinner on 16 January 2025. At the
