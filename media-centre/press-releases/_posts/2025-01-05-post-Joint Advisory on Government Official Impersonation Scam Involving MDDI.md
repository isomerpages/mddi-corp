<p>The Singapore Police Force (SPF) and the Ministry of Digital Development
and Information (MDDI) would like to alert the public on a Government Official
Impersonation Scam involving agencies such as MDDI.</p>
<ol start="2" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>In this variant, victims receive a call from scammers purporting to be
government officials from MDDI. In most cases, the call appears to be made
from a local number. In some cases, scammers also claimed to be officials
from other agencies like the SPF, Monetary Authority of Singapore or SingCert.
The scammers would allege that the victim’s Singapore mobile number had
been misused in job scam advertisements in Malaysia. The scammers may also
attempt to transfer the victim to a ‘Malaysia Interpol’ official.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In most Government Official Impersonation Scam cases, scammers impersonating
government officials would direct victims to disclose their personal particulars,
banking credentials and/or transfer money into a bank account provided
by the scammers.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Government officials will never ask members of the public over the phone
to:</p>
<p>a) transfer monies to them.</p>
<p>b) provide their personal particulars or banking credentials.</p>
<p>c) install non-Government mobile apps from unofficial app stores.</p>
<p>d) transfer the call directly to SPF, except when you call 995 for life-threatening
emergencies.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Members of the public are also encouraged to adopt the following precautionary
measures:</p>
<p>a) <strong>ADD</strong> – Add the ScamShield app to block and filter SMSes.
Set up security features (e.g. set up transaction limits for internet banking
transactions / credit/debit card transactions, enable Two-Factor Authentication
(2FA), Multifactor Authentication for banks and e-wallets, use the Money
Lock feature of your bank to “lock up” a portion of your money so that
it cannot be transferred out digitally by anyone, further protecting your
savings from scams). Do not send money to anyone you do not know or have
not met in person before. Do not disclose your bank / card details and
One-Time Passwords (OTPs) to anyone.</p>
<p>b) <strong>CHECK</strong> – Check for scam signs with official sources such
as the ScamShield Helpline (1799). You can also check the legitimacy of
suspicious messages, phone numbers and website links via the ScamShield
app or visit the ScamShield website at <a href="www.scamshield.gov.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">www.scamshield.gov.sg</a>. Note that from
1 July 2024, government SMSes will be sent from a single Sender ID gov.sg.</p>
<p>c) <strong>TELL</strong> – Tell the authorities, family, and friends about
scams. Report and block suspected scam accounts/chat groups. Call your
bank immediately and make a police report if you think you have fallen
victim.</p>
