<p>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “We
Are Number 1” 《没马跑》 follows the story of the Ma family’s attempts to keep
their traditional soup shop Guifei Yintang《贵妃饮汤》afloat, once a popular
haunt known for its delicious soups and warm hospitality but has since
seen declining patronage. After a series of twists and turns, the Ma family
saves the business with unexpected and heartwarming results, with the help
of neighbourhood friends, the Wu and Zhao families. The cast navigates
finding new life purposes, business failures, and broken relationships
to eventually emerge as “Number 1” in both life and love, forging new paths
to success.</p>
