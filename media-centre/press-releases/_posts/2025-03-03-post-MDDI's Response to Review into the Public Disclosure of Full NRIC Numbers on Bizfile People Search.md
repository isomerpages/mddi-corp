<p><strong>MDDI’S RESPONSE TO THE REPORT OF THE REVIEW INTO THE PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF FULL NRIC NUMBERS ON BIZFILE PEOPLE SEARCH</strong>
</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>We accept the findings and recommendations from the Panel’s Report of
the Review into the Public Disclosure of Full NRIC Numbers on Bizfile People
Search.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>We apologise again for&nbsp;our oversight, which had&nbsp;caused&nbsp;public
anxiety and concerns.&nbsp;In this incident, the Public Service did not
perform to the level we set for ourselves.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We are taking immediate steps to prevent similar incidents.</p>
<p>a. One, we are developing further guidance to government agencies on how
the policy on NRIC numbers should be applied. We have identified almost
800 existing use cases of partial NRIC numbers in public-facing systems,
each with their specific context and characteristics. We will improve coordination
with implementing agencies to support them in their assessment of the complexity
and appropriate design of each use-case, and strengthen responses to public
queries.</p>
<p>b. Two, as the policy owner for use of NRIC numbers, we will strengthen
our internal processes and staff training to provide clear explanations
of the broader policy context and considerations when issuing policy directives
to the wider Public Service.</p>
<p>c. Three, we have reminded agencies of the Government’s existing data
management policies and standards regarding the collection, use and disclosure
of personal data, which include NRIC numbers. We will conduct refresher
briefings to reinforce understanding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We have thoroughly reviewed the actions and responsibilities of the officers
involved in this incident. While there was no malicious intent or wilful
wrongdoing, there were shortcomings in the communication and implementation
of policy changes in the use of NRIC numbers. The appropriate actions are
being taken with the officers and leaders involved. This includes reviewing
performance assessments, which will carry financial consequences, as well
as counselling and additional training.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Government remains committed to protecting citizens’ personal data
while ensuring its secure use to serve our citizens better. We will learn
from this incident and do better. On the use of NRIC numbers in the private
sector, MDDI will be consulting industry and the public before any changes
in guidelines. We will also step up public education efforts on the incorrect
uses of NRIC numbers, and will provide more details in due course.</p>
