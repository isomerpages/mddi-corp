<p><strong>Further S$120M investment in “AI for Science”</strong>
</p>
<p>1. A key part of Singapore’s refreshed National AI Strategy (NAIS 2.0)
is to build up a vibrant and innovative AI research ecosystem.</p>
<p>2. In support of this, the Government will be making a new S$120 million
investment in “AI for Science”. Led by the National Research Foundation
(NRF), the “AI for Science” initiative will focus on the development and
adoption of AI methods and tools that are transferable across multiple
domains of science to enhance research productivity and advance scientific
discovery. It will fund deep collaborations between AI researchers and
scientific domain experts in thematic areas that are of interest to Singapore,
such as advanced materials research and biomedical and health sciences.
The initiative will also solicit bottom-up proposals, which can be in other
thematic areas proposed by the research community.</p>
<p>3. The “AI for Science” initiative will cultivate a new generation of
interdisciplinary researchers who are ‘bilingual’, or proficient in both
AI technologies and one or more scientific domains. It will also assist
researchers with access to and sharing of relevant datasets and compute
resources, and promote the collocation of researchers to foster co-creation
and maximise transferability of capabilities and expertise to multiple
domains of science. Additionally, it will support collaborations between
Singapore-based researchers and international counterparts to fill in capability
gaps and seed new expertise in Singapore.</p>
<p>4. By bringing together experts in AI and scientific research, the “AI
for Science” initiative seeks to ensure that Singapore can benefit from
the latest advancements and breakthroughs in AI for scientific discovery
and that Singapore’s research community remains competitive and vibrant,
driving innovation towards Singapore’s national imperatives and economic
development.</p>
