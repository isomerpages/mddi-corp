**Sentosa, Singapore:** Ministers and senior government officials from around the world[^1]  met today at the ATxSummit for a closed-door Government-to-Government Roundtable discussion on AI Governance and Scams (“Roundtable”). Minister for Communications and Information and Second Minister for Home Affairs Mrs Josephine Teo, who Chaired the Roundtable, released the following Chair’s Summary:  
  

“At the Government-to-Government Roundtable on 7 June, we discussed the topics of AI Governance and Scams, which are part of broader global digital and technological developments, that could have a significant impact on trust in society, and our countries’ plans to seize opportunities in the digital age. We had a good exchange of views on how governments and policymakers have shaped our collective policy response.”  
  
On **AI Governance**, the Roundtable discussed the advancements in AI, including the emergence of generative AI models such as ChatGPT, and their potential to propel economic growth and enhance human potential in a digital era. Participants agreed that AI should be appropriately governed and used for the good of humanity. They discussed the importance of collaboration in informing AI governance policies, and encouraged greater interoperability of governance frameworks to facilitate responsible development and deployment of AI technologies by industry globally. They also recognised that infusing AI ethics at the early stages of education, and prioritising investments in reskilling and upskilling, were crucial aspects of AI governance that must be addressed. Participants agreed that increased collaboration and mutual information exchange could help in discovering shared ground and greater alignment in our approaches to develop sustainable and fit-for-purpose AI governance frameworks, technical standards, and science-backed tools.   
  
On **scams**, Roundtable participants shared their respective countries’ challenges and the specific measures they have put in place to tackle the issue. They agreed that scams are a global problem and an important threat to address especially as scammers become more sophisticated and leverage more technology to scale their operations. Participants also acknowledged that international cooperation on scams is essential to tackle this transboundary issue well, and committed to explore anti-scam efforts together.”
