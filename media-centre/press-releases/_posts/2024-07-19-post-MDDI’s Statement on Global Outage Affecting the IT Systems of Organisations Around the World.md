<li>
<p>We are aware of a global outage affecting the IT systems of organisations
around the world, including Singapore. With the information we have currently,
it is a technical issue involving software from Microsoft and Crowdstrike,
and not a cybersecurity incident.</p>
<p></p>

<li>
<p>While government services are not affected, we are aware that this has
affected several companies in Singapore in delivering services to the public.
This includes check-in services for airlines, publishing of newspapers
and carparks. Our local banks, telcos and hospitals are not affected.</p>
<p></p>

<p>We are monitoring the impact and assisting companies to help them recover.</p>
