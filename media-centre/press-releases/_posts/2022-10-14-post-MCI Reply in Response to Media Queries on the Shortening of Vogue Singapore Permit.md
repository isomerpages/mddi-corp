1. MCI has issued Vogue Singapore a stern warning and shortened the permit for Vogue Singapore from one year to six months, as it had breached the Content Guidelines for Local Lifestyle Magazines on four occasions within the past two years, for nudity and content that promoted non-traditional families. During the period of Vogue Singapore’s breaches, the Content Guidelines have remained the same.  Vogue Singapore is required to comply with the Content Guidelines as part of its permit conditions, which includes not undermining prevailing social norms.

2. As a matter of process, Vogue Singapore’s current one-year permit has been revoked with effect from 13 Oct 2022. Vogue Singapore has re-applied and MCI has since issued Vogue Singapore a six-month permit.
