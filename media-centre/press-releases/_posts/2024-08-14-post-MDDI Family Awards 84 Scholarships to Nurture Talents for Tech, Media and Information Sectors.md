<p><strong>MDDI Family Awards 84 Scholarships to Nurture Talents for Singapore's Tech, Media and Information Sectors</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>SINGAPORE, 14 Aug 2024</strong> — 84 scholarships were awarded
today by the Ministry of Digital Development and Information (MDDI), and
its statutory boards and agencies - Cyber Security Agency of Singapore
(CSA), Government Technology Agency (GovTech), Infocomm Media Development
Authority (IMDA), and National Library Board (NLB). The scholarship award
ceremony was hosted by Mrs Josephine Teo, the Minister for Digital Development
and Information and Minister-in-charge of Smart Nation and Cybersecurity.
This is MDDI family’s first scholarship award ceremony following the merger
of the Ministry of Communications and Information and the Smart Nation
and Digital Government Group last October.</p>
<p>2. The scholarships are part of MDDI family’s collective effort to nurture
talents in technology, media, library, and archives services and communications
areas, allowing them to lead a range of digital development and government
communications work across public and private sectors. A total of three
types of scholarship were awarded to the recipients:</p>
<p><strong>(A) Undergraduate Scholarships</strong>
</p>
<p>3. The MDDI Family offers three categories of scholarships to support
students pursuing bachelor’s degrees relevant to the ministry, statutory
boards, or agencies:</p>
<p>i. <u>MDDI Information Service Scholarship</u>
</p>
<p>3 recipients were awarded the MDDI Information Service Scholarship. This
scholarship was first introduced in 2008 to attract young talents with
an interest in government communications. They will play an important role
in public communications to ensure that citizens are heard and connected
to the Government, through engaging citizens on national and social issues
in various channels, strengthening policy communications at whole-of-government
level, communicating policies to the public, and managing&nbsp; government
media relations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>ii. <u>NLB Scholarship</u>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3 recipients were awarded the NLB Scholarship. Through the NLB Scholarship,
NLB&nbsp; aims to build and nurture a multi-disciplinary talent pipeline
in information literacy,&nbsp; knowledge creation and preservation to develop
Singapore’s libraries and archives of&nbsp; the future. These scholarship
holders will play a key role in realising NLB’s goal of&nbsp; transforming
the reading and learning experience for all Singaporeans. They will also&nbsp;
contribute to NLB’s roles in building a Learning Marketplace, nurturing
an Informed&nbsp; Citizenry, inspiring Singapore Storytellers, and being
an Equaliser as envisioned&nbsp; through LAB25 (Libraries and Archives
Blueprint 2025).&nbsp;</p>
<p>iii. <u>Smart Nation Scholarship</u>&nbsp;</p>
<p>8 recipients were awarded the Smart Nation Scholarship (SNS). The SNS
seeks to&nbsp; develop future technology leaders who are passionate in
making a difference to our&nbsp; national digital transformation. Jointly
offered by CSA, GovTech, and IMDA, scholars&nbsp; can look forward to a
multifaceted career, specialising in a variety of tech domains and&nbsp;
opportunities for job rotations across the different public agencies.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>(B) MDDI Postgraduate Scholarship&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>4. Beyond attracting and growing young talents, MDDI family also strives
to develop in service officers’ professional and specialised capabilities
through the MDDI Postgraduate&nbsp; Scholarship, which was awarded to 2
MDDI officers this year, to pursue postgraduate studies.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>(C) IMDA SG Digital Scholarship&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>5. In addition to developing talents for the public sector, MDDI family
also aims to develop&nbsp; future leaders for Singapore’s technology and
media ecosystem. 68 recipients were awarded&nbsp; the IMDA SG Digital Scholarship,
an industry scholarship that provides both undergraduate and&nbsp; postgraduate
scholars the flexibility to chart their own career with the industry and
take on key&nbsp; roles in a tech or media-related field in an organisation
of their choice. Recipients will also be&nbsp; supported for certifications
beyond school curriculum, overseas programmes, internship,&nbsp;mentorship,
and networking opportunities with industry leaders, to equip them with
necessary&nbsp; skills to ride on opportunities for a career in tech.&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. These scholars will join the growing community of Singaporean digital
leaders under&nbsp; IMDA’s SG Digital Leadership Accelerator programme,
which comprises over 1,000 tech and&nbsp; media talents, including past
scholars who hold leadership positions, such as founders of high growth
tech startups, leaders in multi-national companies, and innovators building
tech products&nbsp; for the world, in areas ranging from AI to quantum.
The past scholars also pay it forward and&nbsp; mentor the younger SG Digital
scholars.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>7. The scholarship attracts high quality applicants with many focusing
on in-demand skills&nbsp; such as Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning,
Cybersecurity, Data Science and Analytics. For&nbsp; instance, 33 scholars
will pursue AI-related degrees to equip them with the relevant knowledge&nbsp;
and skills to develop and scale the use of AI for organisations and across
the economy. This is&nbsp; part of IMDA’s $20 million investment over three
years to increase the number of AI-related&nbsp; scholarships and overseas
internships to grow the talent pool. These efforts will contribute to&nbsp;
Singapore’s goal of tripling the AI workforce to 15,000 practitioners,
under Singapore’s National&nbsp; AI Strategy 2.0.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
