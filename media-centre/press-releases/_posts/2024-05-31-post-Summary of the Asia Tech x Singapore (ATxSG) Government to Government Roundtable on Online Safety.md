<p><strong>Summary of the Asia Tech x Singapore (ATxSG) Government-to-Government Roundtable on Online Safety by Chair and Minister for Communications and Information Mrs Josephine Teo, Friday, 31 May 2024</strong>
</p>
<p>Sentosa, Singapore: Ministers and senior government officials from around
the world met today at the ATxSummit for a closed-door Government-to-Government
Roundtable discussion on Online Safety (“Roundtable”). Minister for Communications
and Information and Second Minister for Home Affairs Mrs Josephine Teo,
who Chaired the Roundtable, released the following Chair’s Summary:</p>
<hr>
<p>“At the Government-to-Government Roundtable on 31 May, we discussed the
topic of online safety, with a focus on children safety, and AI-generated
misinformation and deepfakes. There was broad consensus that there is an
urgent need to curb the threat of online harms, especially for vulnerable
groups, and for regulations to keep pace with advances in technologies,
such as generative AI. We had a constructive exchange of views on how governments
and policymakers can foster a positive and inclusive online environment
that promotes trust, respect, and meaningful participation for all users.”</p>
<p>On <strong>online safety, with a focus on children safety</strong>, the
Roundtable participants reflected their concern that children, who are
spending more time online for learning, entertainment and connecting with
others, are particularly vulnerable when exposed to inappropriate content
and social interaction online. While industry has taken active steps in
recent years to combat online harms on social media, participants agreed
that tech companies, civil society, and academia can and should do more
to put in place additional protections for children or raise awareness
of online harms that they might face. They also highlighted the importance
of education and partnerships to equip citizens, especially children and
their parents, with the knowledge and skills to use the Internet responsibly
and manage potential online harms. Participants reiterated their commitment
to international collaboration, especially with the increasingly borderless
nature of online harms.</p>
<p>On <strong>AI-generated misinformation and deepfakes</strong>, the Roundtable
participants shared that an online environment saturated with untrustworthy
information can breed polarisation and erode trust in institutions. Participants
emphasised the need to develop national and global governance frameworks
to mitigate the misuse of AI in deepfakes and misinformation, while still
allowing maximal space for innovation to take advantage of the opportunities
which AI offers. They also shared the belief that developing technological
safeguards and improving digital literacy among citizens can strengthen
a country’s resilience to AI-generated misinformation and deepfakes. A
coordinated approach that taps into the strength of all stakeholders is
imperative to nimbly respond to these unprecedented harms in the information
landscape.</p>
