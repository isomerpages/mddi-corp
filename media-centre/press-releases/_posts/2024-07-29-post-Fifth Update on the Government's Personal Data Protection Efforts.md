<p>The Government has published key efforts undertaken to strengthen the
public sector data security regime between 1 April 2023 and 31 March 2024
(i.e. FY2023). This is the fifth annual update. All 24 initiatives recommended
by the Public Sector Data Security Review Committee (PSDSRC)<sup>1</sup> in
2019 have been implemented. (Please refer to Annex A for the full list
of PSDSRC initiatives).</p>
<h3>No Serious Data Incidents over Last Four Years</h3>
<p>There were 201 government data incidents reported in FY2023 as compared
to 182 incidents reported in FY2022. The increase in the number of incidents
is due to the higher volume of data usage as more government services are
digitalised to provide convenience to citizens and businesses. In addition,
improved awareness among public officers on the need to report incidents
may have also contributed to the increase.</p>
<p>The vast majority of incidents were of low severity. This is the fourth
consecutive year with no incidents assessed to be of high severity and
above. Incidents of medium severity also decreased from 46 in FY2022 to
29 in FY2023. This is partly the result of progressive implementation of
security processes and technical measures and increased public sector awareness
on data security.</p>
<h3>Government’s Initiatives to Strengthen Data Security in FY2023</h3>
<p>The Government has progressively put in place various measures since 2019
to enhance the public sector data security regime. The following are key
highlights of government initiatives introduced in FY2023.</p>
<h4>Central Privacy Toolkit (Cloak) Expanded to Include New Features</h4>
<p>Cloak allows public officers to apply privacy-enhancing technologies to
datasets while preserving the data’s value for sharing and use, thus mitigating
the risk of data leaks. Since its launch in March 2023, the toolkit has
expanded its offerings and has been used by 1,400 public officers from
90 agencies. For instance, its free-text anonymisation feature has anonymised
20 million documents and served more than 20 generative AI use cases in
government.</p>
<h4>Deployment of Automation Tools to Prevent Data Compromises</h4>
<p>As of end-March 2024, all eligible systems in the government used the
Central Accounts Management (CAM) tool to automatically remove user accounts
that were no longer needed. This has mitigated the risk of unauthorised
access by officers who have left their roles and the exploitation of dormant
accounts by malicious actors.</p>
<p>Enhancements have also been made to the Government’s Data Loss Protection
(DLP) tool which mitigates the accidental loss of classified and/or sensitive
data from government networks, systems, and devices. For instance, since
September 2023, email recipients can no longer see the email addresses
of other external recipients if there are more than 30 recipients.</p>
<h4>Enhancing Competencies in Public Service</h4>
<p>The Government recognises that it is not possible to eliminate data incidents
entirely and remains committed to respond swiftly to data incidents. From
August to September 2023, the Government conducted the annual central ICT
and Data Incident Management exercise involving 31 agencies across four
Ministry Families. This enhanced the Government’s ability to provide a
coordinated and efficient response when required.</p>
<p>Enhancing public officers’ instincts and instilling a culture of excellence
in using data securely is an ongoing effort. In FY2023, the Government
introduced gamified events to help public officers learn about data protection
in an engaging way. In February 2024, the mandatory Data Security e-learning
module was also refreshed to include content related to new technologies
and prevalent trends, such as Large Language Models (LLMs) and phishing
scams.</p>
<h3>Implementation of All 24 Recommended PSDSRC Initiatives</h3>
<p>All 24 PSDSRC initiatives have been implemented. The Government remains
committed to ensuring a robust data security regime. We will continue to
review the effectiveness of our existing measures regularly, introducing
enhancements or new measures when necessary. New initiatives aimed at strengthening
the Government’s data security will be shared on the Ministry of Digital
Development and Information (MDDI) website.</p>

<hr>
<p><sup>1</sup> The Public Sector Data Security Review Committee (PSDSRC)
made five key recommendations in 2019 to improve the Government’s data
security regime. The Government accepted the Committee’s recommendations
in full and committed to implementing them in phases from FY2020 to FY2023.</p>
<p></p>

<h3>Annex A: Implementation Progress of the PSDSRC Initiatives</h3>
<p>All 24 initiatives recommended by the PSDSRC have been implemented as
of 31 March 2024.</p>
