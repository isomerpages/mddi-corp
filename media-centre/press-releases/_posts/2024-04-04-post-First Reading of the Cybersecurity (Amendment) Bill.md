<p>The Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA) is proposing to amend the
Cybersecurity Act 2018 (“the Act”) through the Cybersecurity (Amendment)
Bill (“the Bill”). The first reading of the Bill took place in Parliament
on 3 April 2024.</p>
<p>2. The Act, which came into force on 31 August 2018, establishes a legal
framework for the oversight and maintenance of national cybersecurity in
Singapore. This is the first time amendments to the Act have been proposed.
The objective of the proposed Bill is to update the Act so that it keeps
pace with the developments in the cyber threat landscape, as well as our
evolving technological operating context. In the Committee of Supply debate
2024, Minister for Communications and Information Mrs Josephine Teo explained
that CSA is seeking to amend the Act to reflect the increasing importance
of ensuring the cybersecurity of the digital infrastructure and services
that power our digital economy and enable citizens to meet their day-to-day
needs, beyond the current Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) it
covers today.</p>
<p>3. The Bill will update existing provisions relating to cybersecurity
of CII and expand CSA’s oversight to cover the cybersecurity of Systems
of Temporary Cybersecurity Concern (STCCs). In addition, we will be creating
two new classes of regulated entities, which will be subject to a light-touch
regulatory treatment. These are Entities of Special Cybersecurity Interest
(ESCI) and Foundational Digital Infrastructure (FDI).</p>
<p>4. CII are computer systems that are necessary for the continuous delivery
of essential services, like water, electricity, banking services and more.
The key aspect of the Bill is that it will ensure that CII owners remain
responsible for the cybersecurity and cyber resilience of the CII, even
as they embrace new technological and business models, like the use of
cloud computing. CII owners will also be required to report more types
of incidents, such as those that happen in their supply chains. This is
so that CSA can have better situational awareness of the cybersecurity
threats that could potentially cause disruptions to our essential services
and work with CII owners more proactively to secure our essential services.</p>
<p>5. There might be times where certain systems are of higher risk due to
temporary events or situations. The Bill will allow CSA to proactively
secure STCCs, i.e., computer systems that are critical to Singapore and
are at a high risk of cyberattacks because of certain events or situations.
An example of an STCC would be the temporary systems used to support the
distribution of critical vaccines during a pandemic. During the COVID-19
pandemic, the vaccine distribution systems deployed by healthcare organisations
around the world were targeted by malicious cyber actors.</p>
<p>6. Besides CIIs, there could also be other entities that are important
to Singapore. The Bill will also allow CSA to designate and regulate ESCI
for cybersecurity if they hold sensitive information or perform a function
of national interest, such that their disruption could cause potential
adverse effects on the defence, foreign relations, economy, public health,
public safety, or public order of Singapore. Examples of such entities
could include autonomous universities. Since they are not CII, the obligations
imposed on the ESCI will not be at the same levels as that for CIIs.</p>
<p>7. Finally, the Bill will require companies that provide digital infrastructure
services that are foundational to our economy or way of life (such as cloud
service providers and data centres) to shoulder responsibility for the
cybersecurity of such digital infrastructure. This includes adhering to
cybersecurity codes and standards of practice, as well as reporting prescribed
cybersecurity incidents to CSA, which will not be at the level of a CII.</p>
<p>8. CSA had consulted extensively on the Bill. Stakeholder consultations
began in 2022, and public consultations on the REACH website were held
between 15 December 2023 and 15 January 2024. CSA took the feedback into
consideration and incorporated stakeholders’ suggestions into the Bill.
A summary of the feedback received, together with CSA’s Closing Note, is
available on CSA’s website. If the Bill is passed, CSA will continue to
consult closely with stakeholders to operationalise the Bill.</p>
