<li>
<p>SME@AiTE is a joint initiative designed to provide SMEs with access to
AI resources, knowledge, and implementation strategies. The centre, housed
within ITE College Central, will host free downloadable AI resources and
hands-on workshops, helping SMEs understand and experiment with integrating
AI technology into their business operations in a risk-free environment.</p>
<p></p>

<li>
<p>At the event, SMS Janil delivered a speech where he highlighted the following
points:</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AI adoption is critical for SMEs to stay competitive and keep pace with
global competition and shifting industry norms.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Government support is readily available to help SMEs digitalise and use
AI. Through platforms like CTO-as-a-Service, GenAI Playbook and Digital
Enterprise Blueprint, SMEs can access practical tools, AI-enabled solutions
and guidance to kickstart or enhance their digitalisation journey.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People are key to unlocking the value of technology. Beyond tech tools,
partnerships like the one between ASME and ITE are helping to grow a strong
talent pipeline by giving students real-world exposure to AI-driven business
solutions through internships and industrial attachments. &nbsp;</p>
