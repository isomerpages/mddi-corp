<p><strong>Extortionary Emails with Deepfake Images Sent to the Public Service</strong>
</p>
<p><em>More than 30 agencies were affected, police investigations are ongoing, and public servants have been advised to remain vigilant and report such emails</em>
</p>
<p><strong>Singapore, 28 November 2024 </strong>- Over 100 recipients across
more than 30 government agencies have reported to GovTech that they received
extortionary emails since 26 Nov 2024. The extortionary emails were sent
to political office holders, public officers and agencies’ mailboxes demanding
50,000 USDT<sup>1</sup> payment in return for not publishing compromising
videos of the political office holders and public officers. The emails
contained an image purporting to be a screenshot from the video in question.
Manipulated images of political office holders and public officers’ faces
were clearly identifiable in the image.</p>
<p>2. All the emails’ contents and images (the purported screenshot from
the video) were the same, with the only difference being the face of the
political office holder or public officer in the image. The images of the
political office holders and public officers appeared to have been sourced
from open sources such as LinkedIn. Please refer to Annex A for the list
of agencies that have reported the emails, and the list of political office
holders affected.</p>
<p>3. The affected agencies have made police reports. The Singapore Police
Force (SPF) has issued an advisory on the extortionary emails at 4.05 pm
on 27 Nov 2024, and police investigations are ongoing. No monetary loss
has been reported thus far. We note that members of the Hong Kong Legislative
Council have also received similar emails on 23 Nov 2024.</p>
<p>4. The Government takes a zero-tolerance stance towards the use of deepfakes
for extortion or harassment purposes. The public officers who have received
similar emails have been advised to report them to the Police immediately.
Members of the public are also advised to adopt the following crime prevention
measures:</p>
<p>a) If you receive a manipulated photograph, video or screenshot, remain
calm. Ignore any instructions to initiate contact or make money/cryptocurrency
transfers. Doing so emboldens the other party to extort more money/cryptocurrency
from you. Report the matter to the Police immediately and provide a copy
of the email to the Police.</p>
<p>b) Never share provocative photos/videos/screenshots of yourself online
or through chat apps as they might fall into the wrong hands.</p>
