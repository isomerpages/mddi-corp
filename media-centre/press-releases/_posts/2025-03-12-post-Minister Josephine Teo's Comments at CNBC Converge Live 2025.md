<p><strong>MINISTER FOR DIGITAL DEVELOPMENT AND INFORMATION MRS JOSEPHINE TEO’S FIRESIDE CHAT ‘HOW A COUNTRY IS LEADING THE AI CHARGE’ AT CNBC CONVERGE LIVE ON 12 MARCH 2025</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Can we just talk about AI, and from the perspective
of yourself as a Minister, what are the biggest opportunities right now
in AI, for Singapore and for the rest of the world?</p>
<p>Minister: The fundamental duty of any government is to its citizens. And
in our case, it's a question of how we create more opportunities for our
people and for our businesses. So that is very much top of our list of
priorities. When you have a technology like AI that is potentially so transformative,
the key question is, how can you take full advantage of it? And the starting
point has to be, what your people are doing in terms of jobs, careers,
and what kinds of businesses are already here. Can AI help them to, individually,
as well as at the enterprise level, achieve new peaks of excellence? That's
really how we're thinking about it. So the idea that AI serves the public
good for Singapore and the world starts from this point. You want people
to have skills so that they can contribute even more to their own businesses,
as well as to their employers. You want businesses that certainly have
to compete very intensely in the global market to find that Singapore gives
them an edge. <strong>That's really where all of our efforts are directed towards—building up the skills and enterprise capabilities so that at the individual, workforce, as well as economy level, we can be more competitive together.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> We'll dig into skills and safety as part of
this discussion, but let's start with Singapore first. Because when we
talk about AI in the world, a lot of the conversation always centers around
the US and China, and the capabilities and companies those two nations
have. A lot of smaller nations are left out of that conversation. Even
big regions like Europe are left out of that conversation. So when you
think about Singapore, how would you assess Singapore's position here in
some of these key technologies?</p>
<p>Minister: It’s a very interesting question, and one that we grappled with
around 2022, 2023 when we were trying to have a rethink of our AI strategy.
The analogy I’d like to draw is if you think about our Changi Air Hub,
where you are right now, and you think about the fact that we serve close
to 40 million passengers a year now, out of the population of not more
than 6 million—how is it possible that we don’t even own aircraft technology?
There are commercial aircraft manufacturers like Boeing and Airbus—they
are not Singapore companies, but it doesn't prevent us from conceiving
of an air hub. You would want to have your own champions. And I think over
the years, we were very fortunate that there were some really excellent
people and outstanding efforts to build up a world-class airline like Singapore
Airlines. We've got very good maintenance, repair and overhaul companies
based here. We've also got aircraft manufacturing. The aerospace industry
is very significant. None of these were built up on the basis of Singapore
owning aircraft technology. <strong>They were built up on the basis of identifying areas where the value-add could be contributed out of Singapore that makes sense commercially to these companies. I think if you adopted that sort of mindset, the same could apply to AI too—the most sophisticated, the highest-end large language model may not be developed here, but it doesn't prevent us from working in partnership with these kinds of inventions and tools to create a value proposition that is relevant in our context and also useful to commercial entities.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> So many people are looking at AI and how foundational
it is. Resiliency is a keyword that is bandied about when you talk about
some of these technologies like AI and semiconductors, and the need to
have a trustful, secure supply chain. And there are many countries in the
world right now, saying that means we need to try to either reshore or
own a lot of that supply chain. So from Singapore's point of view, you've
got a different perspective—you’re happy to work with a lot of these global
partners?</p>
<p><strong>Minister:</strong> I think you’re spot-on in saying that at the
heart of it, the desire is not always to have things that are created and
maintained by yourself. At the heart of it, your main objective is to be
able to achieve resilience. In other words, you want to have choices. You
want to have options in case something happens that is not favourable.
And if you want to achieve resilience, there are different ways of doing
so: achieving diversity in terms of how your supplies are obtained, achieving
diversity in terms of the technology that are being deployed, achieving
diversity in terms of even the design of various systems that you put in
place—these are all contributing towards resilience. And that's how we
think about it. It's not always the case that you have the luxury of owning
the entire supply chain or even the most critical components. You've got
to be able to look at it and say, what is sensible for yourself to produce,
manufacture or store, at least, but what is sensible for you to diversify
in terms of getting the supplies? So that's the way we think about it.</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> It's hard to have a conversation this year about
AI without mentioning DeepSeek because of the ripples it had through the
global markets and technology sector. But what it did show was the importance
of open source and the development of open-source technology, which may
give smaller nations, as well as smaller companies, the ability to create
real applications. One of the conversations I've been having over the past
few months was that actually, a lot of people in tech think that the models
are going to be commoditised, and the real value really, is in the applications
there. And what Deepseek and other open-source models are giving is a chance
for companies and countries to create valuable applications. So how do
you view what's happening in open-source right now, and what it means for
the development of, say, some of these AI applications in Singapore?</p>
<p><strong>Minister:</strong> One of the concerns we had two to three years
ago was to what extent the AI hype would actually translate into real benefits
in the business context. As we interacted with a whole range of industries,
as well as companies of different sizes, operating in different sectors,
facing different challenges, one very common theme was AI is still super
expensive to use. <strong>So if we did the cost-benefit analysis, we are very interested in the potential that AI can bring.</strong> But
the amount of money that we have to put into developing the use of these
AI tools [is high], because it's not just always so easy—buying off the
shelf, and implementing it. You may have to make some adjustments within
your own organisations. The companies told us that it was still very costly
for them to do so. What’s consistently the feedback in today's context
with the introduction of DeepSeek is that, now, the cost considerations
have become quite different. And from that perspective, in terms of being
able to promote AI adoption and boost the development of AI ecosystems
in many more different contexts, I think it's very exciting. And we see
this happening, not just within the Government, in terms of how we are
hoping to use AI tools to improve public service delivery. We see this
amongst the various industries that are operating here, whether it is in
finance, it is in healthcare, in transport, logistics. <strong>The enthusiasm just went up because the cost considerations have become more favourable.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: And that brings me on to infrastructure. There
was the 500 billion dollar Stargate Project in the US recently, and France
had a roughly 100 billion Euro investment in infrastructure as well. Are
these countries spending too much then?</p>
<p><strong>Minister:</strong> It depends on what time frame you ask. I think
if you fast forward 100 years and you say, what's happening today? I think
it's very hard to say that it will be too much. But these things happen
in cycles. In certain points in time, you may have gone ahead of the demand
and find yourself with overcapacity. This happens in many other industries
and sectors too, so I wouldn't be overly surprised if it happens, but the
long-term trajectory does suggest that the needs are going to grow. And
if you look at Singapore’s context, our data centre capacity relative to
our GDP and population, is already one of the densest in the whole of Asia.
And even with that sort of build-up, we're still looking at creating more
headroom, because if you want to be able to host the most sophisticated
uses of AI, latency does matter. Some of the AI workloads cannot be so
easily configured out of the geographical location. So even if you develop
a very robust and extensive network of data centres in our part of the
world, where the activity is most concentrated, you will still need to
have the computer capacity.</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> So does Singapore also need to spend 500 billion
dollars on AI infrastructure?</p>
<p><strong>Minister: </strong>I can tell you that a lot of companies are
spending that money. I was with the former US Secretary of Commerce, Ms
Gina Raimondo, when she was here last year, and we were trying to put together
what the investments were like. Just in digital infrastructure and utilities,
investments by US companies, not including other companies, came to about
50 billion US dollars in Singapore alone. That’s the kind of scale they
are looking at. But I think actually, if you look at the numbers elsewhere
in the region, they are even bigger because the gap is wider and so there
is build up that is necessary to try and close the gap.</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> There are other things to think about in terms
of infrastructure—there’s energy, there’s water; how do you address some
of those challenges?</p>
<p><strong>Minister: </strong>We face up to these challenges, so we say that
for data centres, we have a Green DC Road Map. There are essentially two
strategies. One, you use less energy. Two, you use green energy. And both
are necessary. In terms of how we use less energy, one very practical thing
is that, what are the standards for operating data centres in a tropical
setting? Do you need to be cool to such a great extent or the standards
can accommodate tropical weather? So that is one of the things that we're
doing. But we're not stopping there. We think that even at the algorithmic
level, there must be ways of writing them in a greener manner. So we are
also putting in some research resources to try and make this happen.</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> You were recently at the AI Action Summit in
Paris, France. A big focus of that was around safety and regulation as
AI continues to develop as well. What would you say are you and other global
leaders’ concerns at the moment around the development of AI, because I've
heard warnings around AI getting out of control, outside of sight of human
control, AI having incredible biases written in to some of the algorithms
and the models as well. What are some of the concerns that you share with
the global community?</p>
<p><strong>Minister:</strong> It is interesting because before we had before
we had the AI Action Summit in Paris, there was the AI Safety Summit in
Seoul, Korea and before that, in Bletchley. And the conversation has actually
shifted quite a bit. Because in Bletchley, we were really talking about
extreme risk. What happens when the AI is able to operate entirely autonomously
and there are no longer humans in the loop? Existential risks were also
on the table. The conversation shifted so significantly. I think in Paris,
it was centred a lot more around AI adoption. And with AI adoption, it
doesn't mean that there are no risks. Near-term risks include risk of discrimination—what
if you have generative AI models that are not only inaccurate, but they
also reproduce biases we already observe in society? There are other kinds
of risks. For example, the cybersecurity risks of AI, the AI models itself
can be susceptible to attacks. That's one type of risk. The other type
of risk associated with security is AI being used to develop even more
sophisticated tactics that can infiltrate systems, apart from social engineering
and implementing scams. So these kinds of near-term risks also deserve
a lot of attention. It doesn't mean at all that we forget about the longer-term
risks. Some would argue that they are not so long-term. I think we keep
a very close watch, but at the same time, our citizens want us to give
them the reassurance that you are also dealing with near-term risk. <strong>So the approach we take in Singapore is that we look at the kinds of legislation we already have, and we ask ourselves to what extent they already address the kinds of risk that you will see with the proliferation in the use of AI. </strong>For
example, child sexual abuse materials—if you use AI, it's very damaging
to the families involved. And even without AI, we already have laws against
it. It's a matter of updating what we already have in the law to say that
if you use AI, the law covers it as well, but there will be occasions where
the law does not adequately address the risk. So in the context of elections,
for example, if AI-generated images or AI-generated audio are being used
to confuse the public and our democratic institutions come under great
assault because of that, then you would, perhaps, need to put in place
new laws. And that's exactly what we did last year. We put in place a new
law to address the specific risk of AI-generated content being used during
election periods.</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Is that the approach in Singapore to regulation
because we have seen in the European Union the EU AI act, and that is looking
at a risk-based approach and use of AI. In China, they have gone also for
quite specific laws targeting the use of AI in context, such as deepfakes,
for example. Will Singapore be looking into a broad, sweeping AI piece
of regulation, or more targeted smaller pieces of legislation?</p>
<p><strong>Minister:</strong> At the moment, I think the approach we prefer
to take is to see how the risks materialise and the environment we have
in Singapore supports law-making. If you look at the way in which Parliament
debates bills, credit to all the members, it is on very solid basis, mostly
evidence-based, as best as you can get. So which means that if you put
forward a reasonable proposition to Members of Parliament, you have the
prospect of actually getting the bills passed. And that is what we continued
to do. <strong>We assess the risk and very quickly try and come up with the legislative response to that, go to Parliament and explain to our legislators why this is so important.</strong> It
sometimes results in what may appear to be a patchwork of different laws
and regulations, but the trade-off is that they are much more targeted,
and they are much more specific. I would say that in time come, there may
be a need for us to reorganise some of the bills and the acts that have
already been implemented. <strong>But at this stage, we are prioritising the speed of response and being targeted in terms of the legislative measures that address the problems that arise with digital development and AI implementation too.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Question: </strong>You mentioned that the sort of three AI summits
that have happened and how the conversation slightly moved on. But the
whole point of them was to try to bring together countries to discuss frameworks
and legislations in a global manner. There was a letter that was signed
by many attendees, except for the US, apart from the UK as well. And it
felt to me that as this conversation towards global frameworks continue,
there are so many divisions yet. So how do you go about this? How important
is a global framework around AI safety. And secondly, how do you go about
getting back when there feels to be a lot of competition intention right
now between nations?</p>
<p><strong>Minister:</strong> You know, the way with these meetings, I wouldn't
be overly perturbed a declaration didn't have all the signatures of everyone
who attended. The reason is quite straightforward. In your organisations,
if there is a commitment you have to make publicly, then there will need
to be an internal process to see whether you are able to live up to those
commitments. And there will be countries who look at it and say that that's
too little time—we need to talk to our capital, we need to talk to all
the different agencies. So from that perspective, I completely understand
why there are occasions where declaration did not get signed. It partially
depends on when this draft was surfaced, so I wouldn’t be too concerned
about that. <strong>Having said that, I think at some point, global frameworks are going to be critical. If you talk to businesses operating in multiple jurisdictions and in the digital domain, the porosity means that you are in many markets and to have to deal with a different set of rules each market that you go to, the lack of interoperability is a great impediment to business expansion. It is also difficult to ensure that the citizens of each of these jurisdictions are protected to a comparable degree. And I think over time, these frameworks are going to be increasingly important.</strong> The
difficulty is that the more you want people to sign it, the tendency is
that it becomes more bland. It becomes, where perhaps, it is not at the
right level of ambition, because it has to satisfy everyone's sense of
what's right and what's wrong. I think this is an ongoing conversation
and I don't expect that it will come to any conclusion anytime soon. However,
I am very hopeful and I am optimistic that there are like-minded countries
that are very keen to continue to move forward together, particularly in
the area of AI safety. Just because we want to advance AI adoption and
the build-up of AI ecosystem in all of our countries doesn't mean that
we throw caution to the wind. <strong>If you want this to be truly transformative, we have to give our citizens assurance that is being implemented with great sense of responsibility and also safety.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Question: </strong>Minister, it's hard to talk about technology
without talking about the rapidly changing global political and regulatory
landscape. I was at Mobile World Congress very recently, on stage with
the CEO of Mistral AI, one of Europe’s leaders in large language model.
And he vocalised something that's kind of bubbling under the surface for
a long time in Europe. And he said, we think that it's time for European
companies to look to reduce their reliance on American technology, which
is a discussion that's been being had in the background. But the first
time I heard it publicly vocalised by a European tech company. And it comes
at a time where it looks like the US is going “US First” when it comes
to technology and many other areas as well. How do you navigate that landscape,
particularly as it relates to what you were talking about at the start
of the conversation around resiliency?</p>
<p><strong>Minister: </strong>You know this idea of over reliance is not
new at all. Even as an economy that was developing through the 70s, 80s
and 90s, we looked at Singapore to ask if we are relying too much on a
particular sector? And how do we diversify the economy? I believe, the
first recession that we had post-independence was in 1985 or 1986. It was
very prominent in our minds that if you are only depending on the few engines,
then when the chips are down, you may not have enough to keep going. So
the idea is that we would diversify our economy, the kind of activities
that people were engaged in. Within each of those activities and industries,
you would want to have a diversity of players in those domains. I think
that is quite embedded in our way of thinking. So that's not new in any
way. Having said that, I think you also have to recognise that some countries
are very advanced in the areas of excellence that they have. AI is one
of them. Quantum will be another one. <strong>We will certainly try to build up our own capabilities, but it is not at all realistic for Singapore to say that we want complete independence and to be self-sufficient.</strong> We
decided a long time ago that that was not an idea that was going to work
for us. <strong>We continue to try and engage with all of our partners. It doesn't matter where they come from at the enterprise level, and in many different ways, we look primarily for a combination of performance and also security as well as resilience. And that remains the fundamentals that will drive decision-making.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Minister, I just wanted to talk about the future.
In this age of AI, how you are thinking about fostering the next generation
of tech leaders and things like reskilling as well, which are becoming
increasingly important? I think I saw a story in the last couple of days
that schools in Beijing will introduce AI courses in primary and secondary
schools. As countries around the world think about education and reskilling,
what are you doing at this point when you think about the younger generation
here and how to build them up into a nation of tech forward and forward-thinking
people?</p>
<p><strong>Minister:</strong>  <strong>We continue to try and engage with all of our partners. It doesn't matter where they come from at the enterprise level, and in many different ways, we look primarily for a combination of performance and also security as well as resilience. And that remains the fundamentals that will drive decision-making.</strong>
</p>
<p>So, we paid attention to what we call pre-employment training - universities,
polytechnics, Institutes of Technical Education, those are very important
to us. But continuing education training is probably going to be even more
important. The ability of a young mind to absorb what is of current relevance
is very strong, so we don't need to do a lot to encourage young people
to be savvy in the digital sense. We don't need to do a lot to persuade
them that it is kind of useful to learn coding. Even if you are not able
to do the most sophisticated kind of coding, simple stuff like block coding
is not that difficult, and they pick it up. So I don't have a great big
worry there.</p>
<p>I also think that our educational system has been tried and tested over
many years. We've got teachers who are very invested in helping their students
prepare for what we call “21st century competencies”. What we did interest
interestingly decided was that instead of us trying to impress upon these
educators what is relevant in this new era, it is easier for us to invite
them to a setting like this and listen to people talk about how technology
is changing the world. The educators themselves bring it back and redesign
the curriculum accordingly. So we have a programme that we call the Smart
Nation Fellows to do just that. In other words, don't attempt to, as a
non-expert in curriculum design, change curriculum. You need the curriculum
designers to embrace it and change it for themselves.</p>
<p>But I wanted to shift a little bit of attention onto continuing education
and training. People after they leave their workforce, if we think that
what they left school with is going to last them their entire working lives,
I think that's not realistic. I think in their 40 or 50 years active in
the workforce, they might well probably have to pivot three, four, five,
six times, maybe even more, who's to tell? But the idea is to give them
the support and infrastructure that makes it possible for them to make
this pivot. One programme that I'm particularly happy about is that, once
you reach the age of 40 in Singapore, and you decide that you have to go
all the way back to school and acquire formal qualifications all over again,
we now a scheme that can support you going back to school for up to two
years, you can do it on a full-time or part-time basis. What the country,
what the state, decides to do is that your financial commitments, we will
help you fulfill it. Meaning that not only when you go back to school,
there are subsidies for course fees, there's actually a training allowance
that goes to you. In Singapore Dollars, it is $3,000 a month. So, if you
take two years for this programme, that's $72,000 for you to reskill, retool
and be ready for the future. That's how we're looking at it.</p>
