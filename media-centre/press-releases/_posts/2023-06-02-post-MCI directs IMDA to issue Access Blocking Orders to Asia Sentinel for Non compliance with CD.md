1. Following Asia Sentinel’s non-compliance with the Correction Direction issued on 26 May 2023 for falsehoods in its article “Singapore kills a Chicken to Scare the Monkeys” (**“the article”**), the Minister for Communications and Information has directed the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) to issue Access Blocking Orders. The Access Blocking Orders require internet access service providers to disable access for end-users in Singapore to the online location where the falsehoods were communicated.  
  
2. The Correction Direction issued to Asia Sentinel had required the facts to be juxtaposed against the falsehoods, so that end-users in Singapore can read both versions and draw their own conclusions. Asia Sentinel did not comply with the Correction Direction. While Asia Sentinel carried the Correction Notices, this was not done in compliance with the requirements of the Correction Direction for the respective Correction Notices to be situated at the top of the article and at the top of the main page of the website. Should Asia Sentinel subsequently comply with the full requirements of the Correction Direction, the Minister will cancel the Access Blocking Orders.  
  
3. For facts of the case, please refer to the Factually article “Corrections regarding false statements of fact in Asia Sentinel’s article “Singapore kills a Chicken to Scare the Monkeys” published on 24 May” ([https://www.gov.sg/article/factually260523](https://www.gov.sg/article/factually260523))
