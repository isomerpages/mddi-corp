<h4><strong>AI Initiatives to Transform Life, Work and Business in Singapore</strong></h4>
<p>1. At its Committee of Supply (COS) Debate 2025, the Ministry of Digital
Development and Information (MDDI) announced new Artificial Intelligence
(AI) initiatives to enhance the quality of life for Singaporeans, equip
workers with AI capabilities, and boost business productivity. These efforts
are in line with Singapore’s National AI Strategy 2.0 and Smart Nation
2.0 vision, underscoring AI’s pivotal role in fostering inclusive growth,
driving innovation, and building trust across society.</p>
<p><strong>For People: Building the Community and Uplifting Digital Proficiency</strong>
</p>
<p>2. AI is rapidly shaping the way we live, work and interact. From smart
assistants that simplify daily tasks to AI-powered services that enhance
productivity, AI has become increasingly embedded in our daily lives. As
AI adoption accelerates, it is important for all Singaporeans to understand
how to use AI effectively, safely and responsibly, ensuring an inclusive
digital future for all.</p>
<p>3. The Government is providing additional support to citizens in developing
skills and attitudes to leverage such new technology in their daily lives
through two key initiatives:</p>
<p>a) The Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) is <strong>enhancing its Digital Skills for Life (DSL) framework and collaborating with partners to offer new content and programmes on Generative AI (GenAI)</strong>.
These resources will teach the fundamentals of GenAI, explain potential
risks, and provide guidance to individuals to use GenAI safely in their
daily lives. Refer to <a href="/files/Press Releases 2025/Annexes___AI_Initiatives_to_Transform_Life_Work_and_Business_in_Singapore.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Annex A</a> for
more details.</p>
<p>b) To drive awareness of how emerging technologies can benefit citizens,
the National Library Board (NLB) will <strong>introduce experiential showcases across public libraries</strong> to
give the public firsthand opportunities to experience how technologies
like GenAI can benefit them in common and daily activities. These showcases
aim to foster excitement about the possibilities of such innovations, as
well as understanding of the limitations and responsibilities when using
them. More details will be shared when ready.</p>
<p>4. Through these initiatives, the Government encourages all citizens to
take advantage of these resources and embrace the digital future with confidence.</p>
<p><strong>For Workers: Strengthening AI Capabilities and Staying Competitive</strong>
</p>
<p>5. AI is transforming our economy and the way we work and conduct business.
For Singapore’s workforce to stay ahead, they need to be equipped with
the skills required to work alongside AI technologies. The Government is
committed to helping the workforce strengthen their AI capabilities through
targeted training programmes.</p>
<p>6. With the updated Skills Framework for Infocomm Technology (ICT), IMDA
is working with SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG) to <strong>expand the SkillsFuture for Digital Workplace 2.0 (SFDW 2.0) to incorporate AI and GenAI content within the curriculum</strong>,
including opportunities for workers to gain hands-on experience in using
AI tools to improve productivity and effectiveness at the workplace. Refer
to <a href="/files/Press Releases 2025/Annexes___AI_Initiatives_to_Transform_Life_Work_and_Business_in_Singapore.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Annex B</a> for
more details.</p>
<p>7. By broadening access to AI upskilling opportunities, the Government
is empowering Singaporeans to thrive in an AI-driven economy.</p>
<p><strong>For Business: Adopting AI and Unlocking New Growth Opportunities</strong>
</p>
<p>8. AI adoption is crucial for business to enhance productivity, stay competitive
and unlock new growth opportunities. To help enterprises adopt emerging
technologies effectively, the Government is introducing initiatives that
provide structured guidance and targeted support.</p>
<p>a) To make AI adoption more accessible, IMDA is launching a <strong>GenAI Playbook for Enterprises designed to cater to enterprises at different stages of digital maturity</strong> so
that they can use AI confidently to boost productivity and spur growth.
Refer to <a href="/files/Press Releases 2025/Annexes___AI_Initiatives_to_Transform_Life_Work_and_Business_in_Singapore.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Annex C</a> for
more details.</p>
<p>b) IMDA is also introducing the <strong>GenAI Navigator for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs)</strong>,
a tool that recommends GenAI solutions that SMEs can adopt specific to
their business needs. Solutions recommended have been pre-approved and
come with grant support. Refer to <a href="/files/Press Releases 2025/Annexes___AI_Initiatives_to_Transform_Life_Work_and_Business_in_Singapore.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Annex D</a> for
more details.</p>
<p>9. These initiatives will provide businesses with guidance and reduce
barriers to AI adoption, helping Singapore’s enterprises to remain competitive
in an AI-driven economy. Both the GenAI Playbook and the GenAI Navigator
will be accessible from the CTO-as-a-Service platform.</p>
