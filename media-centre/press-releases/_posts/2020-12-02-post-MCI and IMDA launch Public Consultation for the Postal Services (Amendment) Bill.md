*Joint Press Release by MCI and IMDA*

**MCI AND IMDA LAUNCH PUBLIC CONSULTATION FOR THE POSTAL SERVICES (AMENDMENT) BILL**&nbsp;

1. The Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI) and Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) today launched an online public consultation to seek views on proposed legislative amendments to the Postal Services Act (PSA). The PSA was last amended in 2007.  
  
2. The proposed amendments aim to support the transformation of Singapore’s last-mile parcel delivery infrastructure to better address market and technological changes against a backdrop of e-commerce growth and declining mail volumes. The amendments will enable IMDA to facilitate the deployment of a new nationwide network of parcel lockers to complement the existing letterbox infrastructure, and also strengthen IMDA’s regulatory oversight of the postal sector.&nbsp;  
  
3. The proposed amendments include:&nbsp;

    a) Allowing IMDA, as the appointed Postal Authority, to install, own and operate the public parcel locker network at specified premises (such as the common property of HDB housing estate buildings, public transport nodes, and community centres/clubs managed or run by the People’s Association);  
    b) Allowing IMDA to appoint a public parcel locker network operator;  
    c) Providing IMDA with the powers to require building owners and developers to provide space for the installation and operation of the nationwide parcel lockers at specified premises; and  
    d) Providing IMDA with enforcement powers and specifying offences relating to the use of the public parcel locker network, including the powers to investigate any unsafe use of the network, such as the presence of objects in public parcel lockers which are contrary to public safety and security.

4. More information is available on&nbsp;[MCI's public consultation page]. All submissions for the public consultation must reach MCI/IMDA by 6 pm on 23 December 2020.
