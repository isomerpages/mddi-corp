<p><strong><u>MEDIA FACTSHEET: 3 OF 5</u></strong>
</p>
<p><strong>New Smart Nation Educator Fellowship to deepen expertise in developing digital proficiency among students</strong>
</p>
<p>1. The Ministry of Digital Development and Information and the Ministry
of Education (MOE) will launch the Smart Nation Educator Fellowship in
2025 to grow a pool of experts in the Education Service to continuously
hone the digital proficiency of our students. It is envisioned that Fellows
will lead and inspire their peers to strengthen the development of students’
digital skills and cyber wellness, such as through the design of meaningful
teaching and learning experiences.</p>
<p>2. Educators play an important role in inspiring our students to embrace
the potential of technology, and navigating the risks involved. Educators
need up-to-date insights on digital issues, their implications on society,
and their impact on teaching or learning. This helps them to better understand
their students’ needs in digital skills and cyber wellness development,
and how best to approach these needs.</p>
<p>3. Under the six-month<sup>1 </sup>Fellowship programme, participants
will gain insights on emerging technological trends through practical,
real-world experiences of technology. They can also look forward to engaging
in panel discussions with local and international industry experts, academics,
and policymakers, and participating in hands-on workshops and learning
journeys. The programme will allow participants to translate the knowledge
and skills they acquire into curriculum design or effective teaching and
learning strategies that support students’ development of digital skills.</p>
<p>4. Participants who are keen to delve deeper into digital issues and their
implications on society are welcome to sign up for optional modules under
the Fellowship. These modules could include visits to companies or deep
dives on specific topics.</p>
<p>5. Over the next five years, we will aim to provide Fellowship opportunities
to build a core pool of about 250 educators with deep knowledge on ways
to effectively develop students’ digital skills. The Fellowship is targeted
primarily at Teacher Leaders and Senior Specialists2 who play an important
role in shaping the national curriculum and championing professional development
and pedagogical excellence among the teaching fraternity. These roles enable
them to effectively share their insights from the Fellowship with other
teachers and amplify the Fellowship’s benefits across the education system.</p>
<p>6. This Fellowship complements existing professional learning support
to upskill our teachers, such as opportunities offered by the National
Institute of Education and the Academy of Singapore Teachers, including
out-of-classroom learning opportunities such as the Teacher Work Attachment
Plus programme and Learning Journeys.</p>
