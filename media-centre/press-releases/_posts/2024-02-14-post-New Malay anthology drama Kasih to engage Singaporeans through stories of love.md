<p><strong>SINGAPORE, 14 February 2024 </strong>– The Ministry of Communications
and Information (MCI), in collaboration with Papahan Films, have produced
a music driven short film anthology series entitled <em>Kasih </em>(“Love”). <em>Kasih</em> launched
on 14 February 2024 and consists of six 10-min episodes. The mixed-language
(English-Malay) anthology explores the concept of love in its multitude
of forms – between family members, friends, acquaintances and fellow Singaporeans.
This new web series features a talented cast of artistes such as Ainon
Talib, Azura Goh, Erwin Shah Ismail, Fizah Nizam, Hisyam Hamid, Iskandar
Ismail, Izzat Yusoff, Khairuddin Samsudin, Rae Saleha, Sani Hussain, Shahril
Wahid, Yuslina Yussof and many more.</p>
<p><em>Kasih </em>aims to inform and engage Singaporeans on the various Government
support measures such as housing grants, childcare subsidies and CDC vouchers.
It also shares timely information on issues such as scams, workplace fairness,
and cost of living. Other ongoing initiatives, such as Majulah Package
and HealthierSG, will also be covered in the anthology.</p>
<p>Two episodes were released on <a href="http://Gov.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Gov.sg</a>’s YouTube channel on 14 February 2024.
The six-episode series will be tied together by a 90s-style rock Original
Soundtrack (OST) about love, hope and resilience, while creating a sense
of nostalgia.</p>
<p>Mr Aaron Lye, Director of Campaigns and Productions at MCI says: “In MCI,
we try to find creative ways to address public issues as well as raise
awareness on various Government initiatives and support measures. With <em>Kasih</em>,
we aim to better connect with members of the community through stories
of love as well as music.”</p>
<p>Creative Director of Papahan Films, Mr Raihan Halim, added, “<em>Kasih</em> continues
my journey as a filmmaker in telling unique, emotional and uplifting stories.
The series is a labour of love and getting to recreate a 90s OST makes
it a more unique experience. I hope that <em>Kasih</em> resonates with the
audience as much as it did for me and the team working on it.”</p>
<p>The first two episodes of the web series are available now on <a href="http://Gov.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Gov.sg</a>’s YouTube
channel (<a href="http://go.gov.sg/kasih" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">go.gov.sg/kasih</a>).
