<p><strong>MDDI Poll finds High Level of Trust Among Singaporeans towards the Government’s Handling of Foreign Policy</strong>
</p>
<p><em>MDDI’s 2024 poll found that more than 7 in 10 Singaporeans trust the Government’s handling of Singapore’s foreign policy is in Singapore’s best interest</em>
</p>
<p><strong>Singapore, 27 September 2024</strong> - The Asian Barometer Study
(Wave 6) released today found that China’s influence in world affairs was
viewed more positively compared to the US. The study found that Singaporeans
are slightly more likely to perceive China to be good for Asia and Singapore
when compared to the United States (US). China is also largely viewed by
Singaporeans as the country that will have the most influence in Asia in
10 years,</p>
<p>2 Polling by MDDI have consistently shown that Singaporeans understand
the need for an independent foreign policy. A poll on foreign policy conducted
by MDDI in June 2024 found that Singaporeans felt relations with the US
and China had improved in the last few years.<sup>1</sup> 6 in 10 Singaporeans
rate the relationship with both countries as good or very good. 6 in 10
feel that Singapore should maintain the current level of closeness to the
US and China.</p>
<p>3 The poll also showed that Singaporeans overwhelmingly expect the Government
to act in Singapore’s best interests notwithstanding their personal views
on the US or China. Over 8 in 10 polled are of the view that Singapore
should act in its best interests and not take sides. 7 in 10 Singapore
citizens said they trust the Government’s handling of foreign policy and
that it would act in the country’s best interests.</p>
