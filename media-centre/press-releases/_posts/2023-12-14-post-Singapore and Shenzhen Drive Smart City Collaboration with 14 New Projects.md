<p><strong>SINGAPORE, 14 DECEMBER 2023 </strong>– The Ministry of Communications
and Information (MCI) and Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) announced
the inking of eight Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) with key partners
from Shenzhen and launching of 14 new joint projects at the 4th Singapore-China
(Shenzhen) Smart City Initiative (SCI) Joint Implementation Committee (JIC)
meeting. On the sidelines, four companies signed MOUs committing to be
the first batch to operate in the smart city demonstration zone. These
new projects reflect the continued interest from enterprises on both sides
to build on the good momentum of the SCI and seize new opportunities in
the digital economy.</p>
<p>The 4th SCI JIC meeting was held in Shenzhen and co-chaired by Singapore
Permanent Secretary for Communications and Information, Mr. Joseph Leong,
and Mayor of Shenzhen Municipal People’s Government, Mr. Qin Weizhong.</p>
<p>Mr Joseph Leong said, "Singapore and Shenzhen share many complementarities
given our focus on harnessing digital technologies for the common good,
and our openness to new ideas and talent. I am confident that the Smart
City Initiative will continue to serve as an important platform to pursue
collaboration in forward-looking areas.”</p>
<p><strong>Strengthening Cooperation between Singapore and Shenzhen in Digital Innovation</strong>
</p>
<p>The SCI was launched in 2019 to build stronger digital and business linkages
between Singapore and Shenzhen. The initiative focuses on three core pillars
for collaboration, namely: (i) digital connectivity, (ii) innovation and
entrepreneurship, and (iii) talent exchange development. The SCI seeks
to create opportunities for Singapore-based enterprises to tap the Chinese
market in the Greater Bay Area, and for Chinese companies to enter the
Southeast Asian markets through Singapore.</p>
<p>Eight MOUs were signed at the sidelines of the SCI JIC meeting to promote
collaborations in a range of sectors including AI, innovation and talent
exchange. The meeting also introduced 14 new joint projects in emerging
areas such as AI and sustainability. Notable projects include the use of
AI for logistics in e-commerce, green energy storage, smart rehabilitation
care, and smart city solutions. To-date, a total of 43 projects have been
initiated and 29 MOUs have been signed at SCI JIC meetings.</p>
<p>In addition to the MOUs and joint projects under SCI, the Singapore Shenzhen
Smart City Demonstration Zone is a joint initiative that serves as a testing
ground for pioneering smart city technologies and solutions. Four new projects
were established in the Demonstration Zone, focusing on new-generation
information technology, digital economy, low-carbon solutions, and biomedicine.
These projects aim to unlock innovative solutions and establish best practices
in smart city technologies, and drive deeper collaborations between Singapore
and Shenzhen companies through knowledge sharing and talent exchange.</p>
