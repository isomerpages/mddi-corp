1. The Minister for Communications and Information has directed POFMA Office to order Facebook to disable Singapore users’ access to the Singapore States Times’ (SST) and Alex Tan’s Facebook pages, under Section 34 of the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA).  
  
2. The SST’s and Tan’s Facebook pages have repeatedly conveyed falsehoods and have not complied with any of the POFMA Directions[^1] that they have been served with. Both pages were named Declared Online Locations (DOL) on 6 May 2020, but they have not complied with the requirement to publish a notice stating that they have been declared DOLs by the stipulated deadline. The notice serves to warn visitors to these pages of the previous falsehoods that they have communicated.  
  
3. This is the second time that a Disabling Order is issued against Facebook pages operated by Tan, following his non-compliance with the DOL Declarations served[^2].
