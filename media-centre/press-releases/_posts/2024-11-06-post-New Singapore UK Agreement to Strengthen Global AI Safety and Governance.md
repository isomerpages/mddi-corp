<p><strong>New Singapore-UK Agreement to Strengthen Global AI Safety and Governance</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>London, United Kingdom, 12pm, 6 November 2024</strong> – Singapore
and the United Kingdom have signed a new Memorandum of Cooperation to enhance
the safety and reliability of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies
in its development and use, paving the way for greater public trust in
AI advancements.</p>
<p>2 The Memorandum of Cooperation (MoC) on Collaboration on the Safety of
Artificial Intelligence was signed by Minister for Digital Development
and Information, Josephine Teo, and Secretary of State for Science, Innovation,
and Technology, Peter Kyle. This signing took place during Minister Teo’s
working visit to the UK, where she also spoke at Financial Times’ Future
of AI Summit on 6 November.</p>
<p><u>Agreement builds on longstanding digital partnership between Singapore and the UK</u>
</p>
<p>3 The UK-Singapore Digital Economy Agreement (UKSDEA) took effect in 2022.
Since then, collaboration between the two countries in digital and cybersecurity
matters have continued to flourish, and both countries had inked five Memoranda
of Understanding (MoU)<sup>1 </sup>under the auspices of the UKSDEA. For
example, in cybersecurity, both countries continue to develop their deep
and wide-ranging cooperation across the operational, policy and technical
levels.</p>
<p>4 Singapore and the UK also renewed an MoU on Digital Government Services
in 2022 for another three years to explore innovative approaches to delivering
more efficient and cost-effective public digital services. Areas of collaboration
include digital service transformation, such as through a National Digital
Identity, as well as capability-building through tech exchanges and workshops.</p>
<p>5 The latest agreement on AI is aligned with the commitments made by the
two countries at the AI Safety Summit held in the UK in Nov 2023, and the
objectives of the international network of AI Safety Institutes to align
their work on research, standards and testing.</p>
<p>6 This agreement also builds on the Memorandum of Understanding on Emerging
Technologies signed by both countries on 27 June 2023, which included commitments
to explore cooperation on AI. It captures the active exchanges between
Singapore’s Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA), the Digital Trust
Centre (DTC) at the Nanyang Technological University (NTU) which has been
designated as Singapore’s AI Safety Institute; the UK Department of Science,
Technology, and Innovation, and the UK AI Safety Institute on research
collaboration, international standards development, and safety testing.
It affirms the importance of international collaboration to advance the
science of AI safety and maps out pathways for deeper collaboration on
AI safety, including frameworks around information sharing and intellectual
property rights.</p>
<p><u>Key areas of collaboration under new MoC</u>
</p>
<p>7 The new MoC will strengthen cooperation between the AI Safety Institutes
(AISIs) of both countries. Key areas of collaboration include:</p>
<p>i. <strong>AI Safety Research:</strong> Enhancing joint efforts to advance
the science of AI safety, focusing on developing safer AI systems and risk
management.</p>
<p>ii. <strong>Global Norms</strong>: Collaborating on international AI safety
standards and protocols, including through possible cooperation with the
Network of AI Safety Institutes, ensuring a global approach to AI risk
mitigation.</p>
<p>iii. <strong>Information Sharing:</strong> Expanding knowledge exchange
between the two countries’ AI Safety Institutes to ensure that AI systems
are developed and deployed in ways that are trustworthy and safe for global
use.</p>
<p>iv. <strong>Comprehensive AI Testing</strong>: Joint development of safety
testing frameworks that provide robust evaluations throughout the AI lifecycle.</p>
<p>8 Minister Teo said: "We are committed to realising our vision of AI for
the Public Good for Singapore, and the world. The signing of this new Memorandum
of Cooperation with our important partner, the United Kingdom, builds on
existing areas of common interest and extends them to new opportunities
in AI. Of particular significance is our joint support of the international
Network of AI Safety Institutes (AISIs). Through strengthening the capabilities
of our AISIs, we seek to enhance AI safety, so that our peoples and businesses
can confidently harness AI and benefit from its widespread adoption.”</p>
<p>9 SoS Kyle said: “Developing an effective global approach to AI safety
means having as many voices contributing to that discussion as possible,
and that’s why the UK continues to place such an emphasis on the work of
the International Network of AI Safety Institute, while also strengthening
our own research partnerships. The UK and Singapore share an enduring friendship
and as a key partner on AI safety, this agreement will see us work shoulder
to shoulder to advance research, information sharing and best practices
- to promote the safe development and use of AI across the globe.”</p>
<p>10 Beyond the MoC signing, Minister Teo and SoS Kyle discussed areas of
mutual interest and cooperation, such as in online safety, cybersecurity,
and digital government.</p>
<p>11 As part of this working visit, Minister Teo, who is also Second Minister
for Home Affairs, will also sign a Memorandum of Understanding on Security
Cooperation with the UK’s Home Office. She also visited France where she
engaged government leaders and industry stakeholders on the latest digital
developments and potential areas for bilateral cooperation.
