<p><strong>Singapore, 16 December 2024</strong> – Singapore and Australia
have signed a new Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) reaffirming their commitment
to facilitate Artificial Intelligence (AI) adoption amongst their citizens
and businesses, and promote responsible AI development and deployment.</p>
<p>2. The MOU on Cooperation on AI was signed by Mrs Josephine Teo, Singapore’s
Minister for Digital Development and Information, and Mr Ed Husic, Australia’s
Minister for Industry and Science, during a bilateral meeting on 16 December
2024 held in Singapore.</p>
<p><u>Key objectives of the MOU</u>
</p>
<p>3. This MOU builds upon the foundation laid by the Singapore-Australia
Digital Economy Agreement (SADEA) signed in 2020 and expands the scope
of AI collaboration between the two countries. The MOU also aligns with
Singapore and Australia’s broader efforts under the Comprehensive Strategic
Partnership (CSP) framework, enhancing their shared vision for a digital
economy. Key objectives include:</p>
<p>i. <strong>Encouraging the sharing of best practices between both Al ecosystems</strong> across
the governmental, industry and research domains;</p>
<p>ii. <strong>Facilitating increased access</strong> to Al technologies, markets,
and talent;</p>
<p>iii. <strong>Building linkages</strong>  <strong>between research and industry</strong> to
support the commercialisation of Al applications; and</p>
<p>iv. <strong>Promoting Responsible AI</strong> including support for the
development and adoption of ethical governance frameworks for the trusted,
secure, safe, and responsible development and use of Al technologies; and
where appropriate, the alignment of governance and regulatory frameworks
and tools.</p>
<p><u>Reinforcement of the strong foundation of Singapore-Australia digital ties under SADEA</u>
</p>
<p>4. The MOU is a significant step forward in the two countries' shared
journey towards realising AI for the Public Good; and it is expected to
further strengthen the bilateral ties between Singapore and Australia.</p>
<p>5. Minister Teo said, “This MOU marks another meaningful milestone between
Singapore and Australia. It opens new doors for AI collaboration across
multiple channels – from research institutes and businesses to government.
By fostering public trust through the development and deployment of responsible
AI, we can fully unlock the transformative potential of AI to deliver tangible
benefits for our peoples and businesses, and realise Singapore’s vision
of AI for the Public Good for Singapore and the world.”</p>
<p>6. Minister Husic said, “For the huge benefits of AI to be fully realised
it needs to be trusted, with international partnerships an important way
to ensure checks and balances are in place globally. Together with our
closest partners across the region we’re addressing common challenges,
including the safe and responsible use of AI. Singapore and Australia are
global tech leaders, offering a compelling opportunity for our countries’
brightest minds and leading institutions to build skills and learn from
each other.”</p>
<p>7. Beyond the MOU signing, Minister Teo and Minister Husic discussed domestic
and global AI developments, and other ongoing digital and cybersecurity
collaborations.</p>
