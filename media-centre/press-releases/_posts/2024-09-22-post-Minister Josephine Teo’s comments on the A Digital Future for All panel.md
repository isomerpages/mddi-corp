<p><strong><u>1. Future of Work</u></strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Moderator: ...The world of work, however, we all recognise is going to look quite different in five years’ time, let alone a decade or two down the road. In Singapore's case, how are you ensuring that there is better preparedness for a more digitised world in the context of work, and how can we learn from what Singapore has done so that we are not always having to go back to the beginning to ensure we are better prepared for a world of work that looks so different?</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Minister Teo:</strong> Well, thank you very much for this opportunity
to participate in this great conversation.</p>
<p>My comments will build on what Margrethe and the Secretary General have
said, and that is to recognise the fact that unevenness exists even within
the workforce.<strong> What this means is that there will be some parts of the workforce that are closer to the technology frontier because their employers are already using technologies in innovative ways in their companies, and so that creates an environment for them to pick up the right skills to become even more proficient in the jobs and the requirements of the future.</strong>
</p>
<p>But there will be many other members of the workforce who, for example,
may be employed by some small and medium enterprises that lag in technology
adoption.</p>
<p>Then there are also people who are marginalised. Sometimes it is because
they have special needs; it could be because they have a disability. We
have to be very creative in addressing past barriers that hindered these
individuals in their path to success.</p>
<p>The way in which we are doing this is to enable every single one of the
workers to acquire the skills to be relevant for the future. Part of it
involves working with employers because they create the momentum and strongest
incentives.</p>
<p>But we also need active labour market policies in the form of support
for individual’s learning, putting resources in the hands of individual
workers so that they don't only depend on their employers to provide the
training opportunities.</p>
<p>You need to also build up the training infrastructure so that there is
a good ecosystem of training providers who not only can deliver training
competently, but whose content meet the needs of the market.</p>
<p>All of these have to come together, and the more we can share with each
other how these can be achieved in each of our contexts, I think the better
we are going to be. So, we are very grateful to the UN for putting together
the Global Digital Compact to create the opportunities for us to do exactly
that.</p>
<p><strong><u>2. Role of public-private partnership; launch of AI Playbook for Small States</u></strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Moderator: That brings me nicely to the question of public private partnerships. So, when we are looking at this process, everybody has to play their part. We need to make sure that the rules of engagement not only exist, but that they are followed and that they are implemented, and that there is consequence for transgression, right? We know about, broadly speaking, the challenges of international law when it comes to the implementation and enforcement of consequence. What role, however do you see - maybe you can give us an example in Singapore - the public-private partnership can better foster the implementation and the oversight of what this GDC process may look?</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Minister Teo</strong>: Since Margrethe was talking about AI, that
could be where the example arises.</p>
<p>I think AI being a general-purpose technology, we all want to benefit
from its transformative potential. Yet, at the level of public services,
very often the expertise does not yet exist, and that is where I think
the private sector can be brought into the picture and encouraged to enable
policy makers that make the rules to understand how this technology is
implemented, and that is exactly how we have done it in Singapore. We encouraged
and we invited the private sector to contribute to the development of use
cases, as well as our understanding of the guardrails that need to be put
in place.</p>
<p>But I would go one step further. I would say that the private sector can
do a lot more in terms of helping to build capacity, and the capacity is
particularly important for small states. On the one hand, we see the opportunities.
On the other hand, we are told of the risks. The question is, will we be
left behind as small states?</p>
<p>Now, in this process of figuring out what to do, I think we were really
appreciative that at the UN level, there is an advisory board at the high
level that is constituted in a very inclusive way. This has given us the
motivation to contribute to this process by asking our own Chief AI Officer
to be involved. We subsequently invited the whole high level advisory board
to meet in Singapore so that they could also engage with the Forum of Small
States that was meeting there.</p>
<p><strong>Now, the result of a process like this is that we now have the ability to adopt the principles articulated in the GDC, to help ourselves as nations. And equally importantly, help each other as small states. And in that regard, I am very pleased to note that this process created an opportunity for Singapore and another country that we admire greatly, which is Rwanda, to say: “How about the both of us come together to create an AI Playbook for Small States?” So that is something that we have done, and I hope that this will help all of us.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Moderator: I just love my panel, because everything they say, everybody wants to clap for them.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Margrethe:</strong> Can I say something? I would encourage everybody
to look at the AI apprenticeship model that is implemented in Singapore
because that allows businesses to get to use AI while people in all walks
of life can learn about how to do that. And you get experts who are embedded
in the local community. So, this idea of AI apprenticeships, the Singaporean
model, is really, really inspiring.</p>
<p><strong>Minister:</strong> Thank you very much. We’re happy to share more.</p>
<p><strong><u>3. Thriving with digital</u></strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Moderator: I'm going to do a rapid-fire round. I'm going to ask you for two specific things that when we leave this stage and we leave this room as individuals, we need to consider implementing. We're not talking for policy strokes here. We're talking about things that you think we can do when we leave. Nnenna, you've given us a clue. But can you give us two different ones?</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Nnena:</strong> Connect the schools, connect the young people,
connect my children.</p>
<p><strong>Moderator:</strong> Thank you. Minister Teo?</p>
<p><strong>Minister Teo:</strong> We want to move beyond learning about digital
to thriving with digital. And to do that, we can move alone, and we can
go very fast that way; or we can go together, and I believe that together,
we'll go even further.</p>
