<p><strong>Singapore and the European Union Agree to Strengthen Collaboration on AI Safety</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Singapore, 20 November 2024</strong> – Singapore and the European
Union (EU) have formalised their collaboration on Artificial Intelligence
(AI) safety with the establishment of a new Administrative Arrangement
(AA). This arrangement will enhance cooperation in promoting technological
innovation, and the development and responsible use of safe, trustworthy,
and human-centric AI. It aims to contribute to enhancing economic and technological
advancement in the field of AI. This bilateral arrangement also supports
the wider efforts by the international AI Safety Institutes (AISIs) Network
of which both Singapore and the European Union are members.</p>
<p>2. The AA on Collaboration on AI Safety was signed by Mr Joseph Leong,
Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Digital Development and Information
(MDDI) of Singapore, and Mr Roberto Viola, Director-General of the Directorate-General
for Communications Networks, Content and Technology of the European Commission
(DG CONNECT). The AA was exchanged during a bilateral meeting between Mrs
Josephine Teo, Minister for Digital Development and Information of Singapore,
and Ms Margrethe Vestager, the Executive Vice President of the European
Commission for 'A Europe Fit for the Digital Age'.</p>
<p><u>Key Objectives of the Administrative Arrangement</u>
</p>
<p>3. In line with Singapore and the EU’s work through the AISIs Network,
both parties will establish a framework for cooperation between Singapore’s
Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA), the Digital Trust Centre (DTC)
at the Nanyang Technological University (NTU) which has been designated
as Singapore’s AI Safety Institute; DG CONNECT and the EU AI Office. The
goal is to drive AI safety research; strengthen our understanding of evaluations
of advanced AI; and support best practices and protocols in safe and trustworthy
AI. Key areas of cooperation include:</p>
<p>a. <strong>Information Exchange</strong>: Sharing expertise of information
and best practices on aspects of AI safety, including relevant technologies,
governance frameworks, technical tools and evaluations, and research and
development, for the purpose of advancing AI safety. These may include
expert information exchange with related partners, such as institutes of
higher learning, think-tanks, enterprises, government agencies, or other
ecosystem stakeholders.</p>
<p>b. <strong>Joint Testing and Evaluations</strong>: Conducting assessments
of general-purpose AI models to evaluate their capabilities, limitations,
and risks, including challenges arising from deployment.</p>
<p>c. <strong>Development of Tools and Benchmarks</strong>: Creating frameworks
to evaluate capabilities, limitations, and risks associated with general-purpose
AI models.</p>
<p>d. <strong>Standardisation Activitie</strong>s: For general-purpose AI.</p>
<p>e. <strong>AI Safety Research</strong>: Advancing joint research initiatives
to explore new approaches to promote safer AI systems and manage and mitigate
risks.</p>
<p>f. <strong>Insights on Emerging Trends</strong>: Sharing perspectives on
technological developments in the field of AI to better address evolving
challenges.</p>
<p><u>Arrangement strengthens existing SG-EU digital partnerships</u>
</p>
<p>4. The Arrangement strengthens existing digital partnerships between both
parties, which Minister Teo and EVP Vestager also reaffirmed at their meeting,
including the EU-Singapore Digital Partnership (EUSDP) signed in February
2023 and the EU-Singapore Digital Trade Agreement (EUSDTA) which was concluded
in July 2024.</p>
<p>5. Minister Teo and EVP Vestager also discussed Singapore’s latest Smart
Nation developments and looked forward to further development of our digital
partnership in other areas such as online safety.</p>
