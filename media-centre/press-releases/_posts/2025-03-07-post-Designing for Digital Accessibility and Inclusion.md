<p>1. The Singapore Government is committed to inclusive design, ensuring
that digital services are accessible to all, including people with disabilities.
To reinforce this commitment, the Ministry of Digital Development and Information
(MDDI) announced at its Committee of Supply (COS) Debate 2025 that the
Government’s current Digital Service Standards (DSS) will be enhanced to
provide better guidance to agencies in making digital services accessible
to persons with disabilities.</p>
<p>2. The DSS, developed by GovTech, is a set of policies, standards and
guidelines which helps agencies implement inclusive digital services that
are easy, seamless and convenient for all to use, regardless of age or
ability. The DSS takes reference from the globally recognised Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), which outline best practices to ensure
that web content is accessible to everyone.</p>
<p>3. The refreshed DSS will be expanded to explain the WCAG, and provide
recommendations on how agencies can meet these standards to ensure their
digital services are accessible to all. For example, offering practical
recommendations, such as using tools like WebAIM’s Contrast Checker or
GovTech’s Oobee (formerly Purple A11y) to verify text and image contrast
ratios for better readability, particularly for users with low vision or
colour vision deficiencies. Agencies will also be encouraged to conduct
more user testing with persons with disabilities before launching digital
services.</p>
<p>4. Beyond refining the DSS, GovTech will also enhance its tools to help
agencies meet accessibility requirements and resolve issues early. Oobee,
a tool that helps agencies assess website usability and suggest improvements,
will be upgraded with automatic scanning to detect accessibility barriers
more efficiently, enabling earlier remediation. Agencies can also leverage
platforms such as ISOMER and GoWhere, which are already compliant with
accessibility requirements, to build and deploy digital services.</p>
<p>5. Today, Oobee is already accessible to the industry as an open-source
web accessibility testing tool. The refreshed DSS will also be shared with
the Government’s industry partners for feedback and continuous improvement.
In addition, GovTech will expand its engagement with the community, including
seniors and users with disabilities, to gather direct feedback and validate
the usability and accessibility of government digital services. GovTech
will also collaborate with industry leaders to refine digital standards,
gather insights, and raise awareness through workshops and forums. This
reinforces Singapore's commitment in ensuring that government digital services
remain inclusive, relevant, and user-friendly in a rapidly evolving digital
landscape.</p>
