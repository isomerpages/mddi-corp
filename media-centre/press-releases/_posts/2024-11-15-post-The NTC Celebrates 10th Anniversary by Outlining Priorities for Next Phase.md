<p><strong>The National Translation Committee Celebrates 10th Anniversary by Outlining Priorities for Next Phase</strong>
</p>
<p><em>The National Translation Committee forms the Translation Industry Workgroup, appoints the Translation Technology Advisory Panel and plans to introduce an upgraded SG Translate 2.0.</em>
</p>
<p><strong>Singapore, 15 November 2024 -</strong> The National Translation
Committee (NTC) concluded its year-long 10th anniversary celebrations today
with a conference and appreciation dinner, themed "Connecting Communities
through Translation – Past, Present and Future". Since its inception on
1 March 2014, the NTC has played an integral role in enhancing Whole-of-Government
translation standards and capabilities through a collaborative effort involving
the public, private and people (3P) sectors.</p>
<p>2. Senior Minister of State for Digital Development and Information, and
NTC Chairperson, Mr Tan Kiat How, delivered the opening address at the
conference, highlighting the committee's achievements over the past decade,
and outlining its strategic direction and new initiatives. NTC’s focus
and new initiatives for the next lap</p>
<p>3. The NTC will concentrate its efforts for the next lap on three pillars
of focus, namely: Community, Talent, and Technology.</p>
<p>4. Under the Community pillar, NTC will build on its efforts to engage
the public on translation. It plans to deepen community engagement by championing
translation through bilingualism. The NTC will continue working closely
with our partner agencies, including the Lee Kuan Yew Fund for Bilingualism
(LKYFB), Ministry of Education (MOE), and National Library Board (NLB),
to explore ways to reshape how Singaporeans perceive bilingualism, by positioning
it as a lifelong pursuit. The NTC hopes to galvanise the community to embrace
the mother tongue languages and foster closer community ties through translation.</p>
<p>5. Under the Talent pillar, the Translation Industry Workgroup will be
launched with the goal of identifying ways to further uplift Singapore’s
translation standards. The workgroup will survey Singapore’s translation
landscape, review existing certification programmes, and identify those
with the potential to serve as a national standard. The workgroup’s recommendations
to the NTC aim to allow service buyers to benefit from greater assurance
of translation quality, and to support the establishment of a common benchmark
for professional translators practicing in Singapore. This workgroup will
be co-led by current NTC members – Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim, Chairman
of Bulan Bahasa Committee and Member of Parliament for Choa Chu Kang GRC,
and Associate Professor Susan Xu from the Singapore University of Social
Sciences – and additional suitable members will be invited to join it.</p>
<p>6. Under the Technology pillar, a Translation Technology Advisory Panel
will be appointed. Comprising technology experts, this panel will guide
the NTC on emerging trends in translation technology and offer strategic
counsel on issues relating to translation technology. This will inform
NTC’s strategy for encouraging wider adoption of translation technologies
by the industry and our community. The NTC will be reaching out to invite
suitable members to join the Advisory Panel.</p>
<p>7. Since its inception, SG Translate has become a valuable resource, enabling
government agencies to reach non-English-speaking communities in Singapore
more effectively. Today, the transformative potential of Artificial Intelligence
(AI) can be harnessed to enhance the efficacy and accuracy of translations.
The Translation Technology Advisory Panel will study and make recommendations
for an upgraded SG Translate 2.0. The Panel will explore areas such as
leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) capabilities and strengthening
community involvement to improve the quality of translations.</p>
<p>8. With these new initiatives, NTC aims to build on its success in the
past decade, to continue providing a dynamic, collaborative environment
to advance translation standards in Singapore, engage our citizens effectively,
and support Singapore’s multilingual society.</p>
<p>9. At the appreciation dinner, SMS Tan will acknowledge the contribution
of NTC partners and launch a commemorative e-book, 'Word by Word: Connecting
Communities Through Translation', which reflects on NTC's achievements
and future vision. SMS Tan will also present two sets of prestigious accolades:
NTC10 Special Recognition Awards, which recognises outstanding contributions
and support towards NTC’s initiatives over the past decade, and the Translation
Talent Development Scheme Awards, which supports translation and interpretation
practitioners from the private sector in deepening their skills.</p>
