<p><em>Two-year restriction against Transformative Justice Collective from receiving financial or other material benefits from operating the website and social media pages</em>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Minister for Digital Development and Information has declared Transformative
Justice Collective’s (TJC) online platforms, namely its website and social
media pages on Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and X, as “Declared Online Locations”
(DOL(s)) under Section 32 of the Protection from Online Falsehoods and
Manipulation Act 2019 (POFMA). The Declaration comes into effect on 21
December 2024 and will be in effect for two years until 20 December 2026
at 12pm (GMT+8).</p>
<p></p>
<ol start="2" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>From August to December 2024, five POFMA Correction Directions were issued
to TJC for multiple falsehoods communicated on TJC’s online platforms regarding
the Government’s treatment of prisoners awaiting capital punishment and
related issues (refer to <u>Annex A</u> for the list of Correction Directions
issued to TJC). Each of TJC’s online platforms has met the following requirements
under POFMA to be declared as a DOL:</p>
<p></p>
<p>a. Each of TJC’s online platforms has carried at least three different
false statements of fact that are the subject of active POFMA Correction
Directions; and</p>
<p>b. At least three of these false statements of fact had first been communicated
in Singapore on each of TJC’s online platforms within six months before
20 December 2024.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Declaration does not mean that TJC’s online platforms will need to
cease operations. TJC’s online platforms may remain in operation. However,
during the period the Declaration is in effect, each of TJC’s online platforms
must carry a notice to alert viewers that it has been declared as a DOL,
that it had communicated multiple falsehoods, and that viewers should exercise
caution when accessing it for information.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Operators of a DOL are not allowed to receive financial or other material
benefit from operating the DOL. This is to prevent operators of DOLs from
profiting from the communication of falsehoods in Singapore. In addition,
service providers such as digital advertising agencies, and digital advertising
intermediaries must take reasonable steps to ensure that paid content that
they include or cause to be included on TJC’s online platforms are not
communicated in Singapore on these platforms. Individuals and companies
must also not provide financial support to TJC’s online platforms if they
know or have reason to believe that by doing so, they will promote the
communication of falsehoods in Singapore on these platforms.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The owner or operator of TJC’s online platforms, or any person with editorial
control over TJC’s online platforms, can apply to the Minister for Digital
Development and Information to suspend, vary or cancel the Declaration.
If the Minister refuses the application, an appeal can be made to the High
Court.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Members of the public are advised to be alert to TJC’s history of communicating
falsehoods on TJC’s online platforms, and to fact-check information published
on these online locations. Refer to <u>Annex B</u> for a list of other Declarations
currently in effect.</p>
