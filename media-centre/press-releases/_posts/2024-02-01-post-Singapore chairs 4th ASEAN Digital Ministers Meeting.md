<p><strong>Singapore chairs 4th ASEAN Digital Ministers Meeting</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>ASEAN Digital Ministers Convene at 4th ASEAN Digital Ministers Meeting in Singapore to Discuss Emerging Digital Issues including AI and Scams</strong>
</p>
<p><em>First time after 11 years that Singapore plays host to Ministers in this portfolio.</em>
</p>
<p><em>Discussions under Singapore’s Chairmanship likely to focus on AI governance and fostering ASEAN collaborations to combat online scams.</em>
</p>
<p><em>Exchange of MOU between Singapore and Indonesia on the first day of ADGMIN to deepen bilateral cooperation on leveraging digital solutions and fostering digital innovation.</em>
</p>
<p>1. Singapore is chairing and hosting the 4th ASEAN Digital Ministers Meeting
(ADGMIN) from February 1-2, 2024, along with concurrent meetings involving
delegates from ASEAN Member States alongside Dialogue and Development Partners
such as China, Japan, the United States and the International Telecommunications
Union. The active participation of these countries underlines the growing
importance of the digital domain and the ASEAN region’s digital efforts.</p>
<p>2. This year's ADGMIN welcomes first-time participant Timor-Leste as an
observer. Singapore’s Minister for Communications and Information, Mrs
Josephine Teo, is hosting the meeting as Chair, with Thailand’s Minister
of Digital Economy and Society, Prasert Janthararuangthong, as Vice-Chair.</p>
<p>3. This event holds special significance for Singapore, as it has been
over a decade since the country last hosted the Digital Ministers, then
known as the "Telecommunications and Information Technology Ministers Meeting"
(TELMIN), focusing primarily on telecommunications.</p>
<p>4. Today, under the theme "Building an Inclusive and Trusted Digital Ecosystem"
for ADGMIN 2024, Singapore's chairmanship underscores the commitment of
both Singapore and ASEAN to enhance access to digital technologies, tools,
and opportunities for all. The overarching goal is to empower people and
businesses to benefit from digitalisation while creating integrated, connected,
and secure digital infrastructures and systems.</p>
<p>5. In preparation for the 4th ADGMIN, the 4th ASEAN Digital Senior Officials
Meeting (ADGSOM) took place on January 30-31, 2024, with the signing of
several key agreements, including a Memorandum of Understanding between
the Ministry of Communications and Information in Singapore and Kementerian
Komunikasi dan Informatika (KOMINFO). [Refer to the media factsheet <a href="/files/Press Releases 2024/Media_Factsheet_Annex.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>].</p>
<p>6. At ADGMIN, Part Two of the Joint Guide to ASEAN Model Contractual Clauses
and EU Standard Clauses will also be launched. The Joint Guide aims to
facilitate understanding between ASEAN and EU businesses and streamline
processes for cross-border data flows.</p>
<p>7. During this period, the ASEAN Digital Ministers will engage in comprehensive
discussions, with Singapore set to emphasise key prioritises at this ADGMIN:</p>
<p>(i) Artificial Intelligence (AI) Governance: Acknowledging the transformative
potential of AI, Singapore recognises the transformative potential of AI,
and the need for trust and safety to underwrite AI for the Public Good.
These include appropriate governance frameworks to establish a trusted
environment in which we can collectively harness the full potential of
AI.</p>
<p>(ii) Combatting Scams and Ensuring Cybersecurity: Given the cross-border
nature of scams, Singapore emphasises a coordinated ASEAN approach to protect
citizens, and calls for collaborative efforts in cybersecurity to build
a trusted digital ecosystem.</p>
<p>8. A Memorandum of Understanding between ASEAN and China on Cooperation
in Communications and Digital Technology to promote greater cross-border
digital connectivity will also be signed at this ADGMIN. This MOU includes
areas of cooperation in digital infrastructure, emerging technologies,
cyber and data security, and digital literacy.</p>
<p>9. ADGMIN 2024 serves as a pivotal platform that brings together the collaborative
endeavours of the ASEAN Member States (AMS) in digitally transforming the
region. This collective effort aims to enhance the digital skills and competency
of every ASEAN citizen, fostering an environment ready to embrace emerging
technologies and elevate the quality of life for citizens and businesses.</p>
