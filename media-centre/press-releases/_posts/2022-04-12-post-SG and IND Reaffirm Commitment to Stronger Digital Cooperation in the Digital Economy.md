1. Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI) of Singapore, Mr Joseph Leong and the Secretary-General, Ministry of Communications and Informatics (KOMINFO) of Indonesia, Secretary-General Mira Tayyiba co-chaired the 8th Information and Communications Joint Committee (ICJC) Meeting on Digital Co-operation between the Government of the Republic of Singapore and the Government of the Republic of Indonesia, held virtually on 7 April 2022.

2. Hosted by Singapore, this year’s meeting involved discussions on potential areas of collaboration on Data Governance, Digital Talent and the Digital Transformation of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). Mr Leong and Secretary-General Mira Tayyiba shared about digital transformation efforts in their respective countries, and explored areas where bilateral digital cooperation could advance mutual interests, including initiatives to support the digitalisation of businesses and start-ups. As this year’s G20 President, Indonesia has highlighted these areas as priority issues, and MCI will support and work with KOMINFO on the G20 Digital Economy Working Group.

3. Mr Leong said, “The ICJC Meeting is an important platform for the bilateral cooperation between Singapore and Indonesia. Digital transformation is increasingly important in helping our people and businesses seize new opportunities and markets. The ICJC has given us the opportunity to foster a closer working relationship in bilateral digital cooperation, which will benefit our people and businesses, and accelerate our post-pandemic recovery."

4. Secretary-General Mira Tayyiba said, “I hope we can share the same vision in ICJC while continuing initiatives and cooperation between our neighboring countries. It is important to nurture our digital future by focusing our effort on human centric approach by providing equal and accessible connectivity, ensuring the security and protection of data, equipping the society with the necessary skills in this era of digital transformation, and creating a fair playing field for all actors within the digital ecosystem. The ICJC meeting can be utilized not only as a means to share information and best practices, but also to initiate new cooperation and other initiatives that can benefit both countries.”

5. The next ICJC will be hosted by Indonesia in end 2023.
