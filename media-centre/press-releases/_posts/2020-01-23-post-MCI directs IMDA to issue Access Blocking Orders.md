1. Following Lawyers for Liberty’s (LFL) non-compliance with the Correction Direction issued against its statement on its website on 22 January 2020, the Minister for Communications and Information has directed the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) to issue Access Blocking Orders. The Access Blocking Order requires internet access service providers to disable access for end-users in Singapore to the online location where the falsehood was communicated.

2. The Correction Direction issued to LFL had required the facts to be juxtaposed against the falsehoods, so that end-users in Singapore can read both versions and draw their own conclusions. LFL chose not to comply. The Access Blocking Orders will ensure that the falsehoods do not continue to be communicated in Singapore without the facts placed alongside them. Should LFL subsequently carry the required Correction Notice as specified in the Correction Direction, the Minister will cancel the Access Blocking Orders.
