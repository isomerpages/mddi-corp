<h3>Parliament Sitting on 7 May 2024</h3>
<h3>QUESTION FOR WRITTEN ANSWER</h3>
<p><strong>*77. Ms Usha Chandradas </strong>asked the Minister for Communications
and Information (a) whether IMDA has plans to remunerate writers, authors
and publishers who contribute their works for the purpose of training the
National Multimodal Large Language Model (LLM) Programme and, if not, why
not; (b) what steps are being taken for the launch of the National Multimodal
LLM Programme; and (c) which communities is IMDA engaging with to obtain
feedback on the creation of the Programme.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
</p>
<p>The National Multimodal Large Language Model Programme (NMLP) was launched
in December 2023 as a research programme to build up Singapore’s capabilities
in developing LLMs that can better understand the multi-lingual and multicultural
context of Singapore and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>The NMLP is still a nascent effort. So far, researchers have benefitted
from data such as those from open government publications and records,
as well as contributed content from partners for which no remuneration
was required. In any case, we will continue to adopt a consultative approach
for Generative AI projects trained in the local and regional context. IMDA
has engaged a range of organisations and associations to understand their
views. Specifically for the local writer’s community, IMDA is working with
the National Arts Council for outreach and has also partnered the not-for-profit
organisation SingLit Station to conduct a survey on their willingness to
be involved in research efforts.</p>
