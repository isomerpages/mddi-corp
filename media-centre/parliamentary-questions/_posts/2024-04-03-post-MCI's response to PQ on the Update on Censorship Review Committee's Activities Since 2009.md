<h3>Parliament Sitting on 3 April 2024</h3>
<h3>QUESTION FOR WRITTEN ANSWER</h3>
<p><strong>25. Ms Hazel Poa:</strong> To ask the Minister for Communications
and Information (a) why has the Censorship Review Committee (CRC) that
is to be formed once every decade not been convened since 2009; (b) whether
the Government intends to reconvene the CRC in view of rapid changes in
Singapore’s media and social landscape; and (c) if so, when.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>There is no set time frame to convene a content review committee. The
Government takes into consideration Singapore’s prevailing media and social
landscape in deciding when to convene content regulatory reviews, and the
appropriate format for such reviews. For example, in the lead up to the
Online Safety (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill of 2022, the Ministry of
Communications and Information (MCI) conducted extensive engagements, including
a public consultation with a wide range of stakeholders, to gather their
feedback and suggestions on the proposed measures to enhance online safety.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More recently, to develop the Code of Practice for Online Safety which
applies to designated Social Media Services (SMSes), the Infocomm Media
Development Authority also consulted various stakeholders, including the
designated SMSes, to gather feedback before finalising the Code.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<br>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On specific content, policies and standards, we also continue to consult
a range of advisory committees. These varied approaches provide more flexibility
in responding to shifts in the media landscape, community sentiments and
societal norms.2. The key purpose of livestreaming the Parliamentary proceedings
is to allow members of the public to view the Parliamentary proceedings
real-time, without the need to be physically present in Parliament. Thereafter,
the full records of Parliamentary proceedings are documented through the
Hansard and accessible to all online.</p>
