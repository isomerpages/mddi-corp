### Parliament Sitting on 2 November 2020

QUESTION FOR WRITTEN ANSWER
---------------------------

**23. Miss Rachel Ong:** To ask the Minister for Communications and Information (a) what is the take-up rate for the Seniors Go Digital Programme amongst low-income seniors; and (b) what are measures put in place to educate seniors on online scams and digital crimes, especially in the e-payments component of the seniors' Digital Literacy Programme.   
  
**Answer:**  
  
1. Since the SG Digital Office (SDO) was established in June this year, it has mobilised 1,000 Digital Ambassadors (DAs) to engage more than 36,000 seniors at 35 SG Digital Community Hubs at community centres and libraries island-wide.  Amongst these seniors, 1 in 10 are low-income seniors and have benefited from subsidised mobile devices and data plans through the Mobile Access for Seniors scheme.   
  
2. While we help seniors be digitally connected, we must also ensure that they do so safely. Cybersecurity education is therefore part of the core curriculum in the Seniors Go Digital programme and is embedded in every engagement with seniors.   
  
3. Seniors are taught to identify online scams, cyber threats and online falsehoods, as well as the importance of personal data protection. For example, in the case of digital banking, seniors are advised to enable transaction alerts and not to disclose One-Time-Passwords to anyone.  Seniors who prefer hands-on learning to build confidence can also sign up for an e-payment learning journey and be guided by DAs to make their first e-transactions.   
  
4. Online resources and webinars are also available on IMDA’s website for seniors who wish to learn more. These tips and advisories are developed jointly with the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore, Singapore Police Force and the Media Literacy Council. We will continue working with relevant agencies to identify new topics as the online ecosystem evolves, and ensure that all Singaporeans are able to access the digital world safely.
