### Parliament Sitting on 21 March 2023

QUESTION FOR ORAL ANSWER
------------------------

**9\. Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song:**Â To ask the Minister for Communications and Information whether the Government issues guidelines on the use of local vernacular languages in wayfinding signs and public address systems within healthcare institutions and MRT stations to aid elderly Singaporeans.

**Answer:**

1. Government agencies make their own assessments on when to use the three mother tongue languages to effectively communicate and meet the needs of their stakeholders. In general, counter and service staff are available in the healthcare institutions to assist elderly Singaporeans who need help with wayfinding. In the case of our MRT stations, key information signages such as station names, as well as public address announcements on important matters such as travel advisories, are made using the four official languages.
