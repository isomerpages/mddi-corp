<h3>Parliament Sitting on 2 April 2024</h3>
<h3>QUESTION FOR WRITTEN ANSWER</h3>
<p><strong>42. Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim: </strong>To ask the Minister
for Communications and Information (a) whether the Ministry sets guidelines
for the editorial policy of vernacular news media pertaining to guest writers;
(b) whether there are any reviews done on the content produced for the
“Crossroads” series of articles in Lianhe Zaobao; (c) whether the Ministry
is aware of the content produced by Mr Philip Chan Man Ping for the “Crossroads”
series of articles; and (d) whether public funding of SPH Media Trust will
be tied to a criterion of not encouraging foreign interference.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
</p>
<p>1. The Ministry of Communications and Information does not set the editorial
policy for news media outlets.</p>
<p>2. As previously shared with members, Government funding provided to SPH
Media is intended to support its talent, technology, and vernacular capabilities.
This funding is hence tied to key performance indicators tracking SPH Media’s
reach and engagement, and is not conditional on its editorial decisions.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;The Government has been consistent in safeguarding Singapore
and Singaporeans from foreign interference in our domestic affairs, including
through our local media. For instance, the Newspaper and Printing Presses
Act (NPPA) prohibits SPH Media from receiving funding from foreign sources
for any purpose, without prior approval from the Minister.</p>
