<h3>Parliament Sitting on 7 May 2024</h3>
<h3>QUESTION FOR WRITTEN ANSWER</h3>
<p><strong>*28. Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim </strong>asked the Minister for
Communications and Information (a) whether the Personal Data Protection
Commission (PDPC) will be conducting an investigation into potential violations
of the Personal Data Protection Act in relation to the data breach of a
user management portal that affected 127 schools in April 2024; (b) if
so, what is the expected timeline for completing this investigation; and
(c) whether PDPC will consider imposing financial penalties on the responsible
parties if legal breaches are found.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
</p>
<p>The Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) governs the collection, use and
disclosure of personal data by private sector organisations. Colleagues
from MOE have shared more details about the facts of the incident. PDPC
is currently investigating if any private sector organisation involved
has breached data protection obligations under the PDPA.</p>
