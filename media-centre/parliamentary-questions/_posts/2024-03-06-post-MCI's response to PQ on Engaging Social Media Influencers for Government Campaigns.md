<h3>Parliament Sitting on 6 March 2024</h3>
<h3>QUESTION FOR ORAL ANSWER</h3>
<p><strong>*4. Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song: </strong>To ask the Minister for
Communications and Information (a) whether the Ministry has a budget for
engaging social media influencers; (b) if so, how much is the budget; (c)
what are the contents that influencers are engaged to publicise; and (d)
how will the success of influencer campaigns be measured.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
</p>
<p>The Ministry does not have a budget specifically for engaging social media
influencers. Social media influencers are just one of the channels used
to communicate to Singaporeans. Influencers may be engaged if they can
complement our broader communications efforts. We evaluate the effectiveness
of our public communications campaigns but we do not solely track how influencers
fare.</p>
