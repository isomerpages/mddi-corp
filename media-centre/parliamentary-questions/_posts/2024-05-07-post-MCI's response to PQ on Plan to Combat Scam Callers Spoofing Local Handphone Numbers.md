<h3>Parliament Sitting on 7 May 2024</h3>
<h3>QUESTION FOR WRITTEN ANSWER</h3>
<p><strong>46. Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye </strong>asked the Minister for Communications
and Information (a) whether the Ministry has received feedback that scam
callers are now able to spoof local handphone numbers that do not have
the "+65" prefix; and (b) what is the Ministry's plan to combat this beyond
public education efforts.</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p>Since 2019, the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) has been working
with telecommunication companies (Telcos) to strengthen our safeguards
against calls from spoofed local numbers. Today, any local or international
calls that spoof local numbers will be blocked by Telcos.</p>
<p>With these measures in place, scammers have quickly changed their tactics.
Some scammers buy local SIM cards through illicit means and use them to
make calls from our local networks. Such calls will show up on the victims’
phone as a local number and without the “+65” prefix. These are not spoofed
calls. They come from the local SIM cards used to make scam calls.</p>
<p>We have taken steps to strengthen deterrence against the use of local
SIM cards for crime, and to ensure accountability for the use of SIM cards.
On 2 April 2024, the Law Enforcement and Other Matters Bill was passed
in Parliament. This will make it an offence for individuals to allow the
irresponsible registration and misuse of local SIM cards to facilitate
scams. These new offences will carry a fine of up to $10,000 or imprisonment
of up to three years, or both. IMDA has also tightened the registration
of SIM cards, and started imposing limits on the number of postpaid SIM
cards per subscriber. For instance, since mid-April 2024, each subscriber
is only allowed to sign up for a maximum of 10 postpaid SIM cards. This
strikes a balance between stopping illegitimate purchases in bulk, and
bona fide uses such as multiple subscriptions for family members. Collectively,
these new measures aim to make it more difficult for criminal syndicates
to operate in Singapore, and help deter abuse of our telecommunications
channels.</p>
<p>These measures are part of our multi-pronged efforts to fight scams. We
will continue to monitor the landscape, act on emerging trends, and close
off known avenues for scammers to reach prospective victims. This includes
tightening our measures further, where necessary.</p>
