<h3>Parliament Sitting on 5 February 2024</h3>
<h3>QUESTION FOR WRITTEN ANSWER</h3>
<p><strong>39. Mr Leong Mun Wai: </strong>To ask the Minister for Communications
and Information (a) whether there are any restrictions on the locations
where movies rated NC16 and above can be screened; (b) if so, what is the
rationale for such restrictions; and (c) whether the Ministry will consider
removing such restrictions in light of the rise of online movie streaming
services.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Films classified NC16 and above (i.e., NC16, M18 or R21) are age-restricted
films, which typically contain stronger or more explicit content that would
not be appropriate for younger audiences. IMDA has medium-specific requirements
to ensure that such films are accessed by appropriate audiences.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the public exhibition of age-restricted films, IMDA requires exhibitors,
such as cinemas, to undertake age checks to prevent access by underaged
persons. The exhibition of NC16 and M18 films must be held indoors, or
in enclosed spaces if outdoors; R21 films can only be exhibited indoors
and at cinemas which are outside of the HDB heartlands to further prevent
inadvertent exposure to underaged persons. There are currently no plans
to review these requirements.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Similarly, online streaming services, including over-the-top services
that offer age-restricted content, have measures in place to prevent underaged
persons from accessing such content. These include parental locks for age-restricted
content and the requirement for all R21 content to be locked by default
and accessible only by PIN. These requirements enable parents to use the
parental locks and PIN to ensure that their children access only age-appropriate
content.</p>
</li>
</ol>
