<h3><strong>Forum Reply: Steps taken to make digital services in public and private sectors easier to access</strong></h3>
<p>We thank Mr Robert Cheng Shoong Hock for his feedback (<a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/forum/forum-steps-taken-to-make-digital-services-in-public-and-private-sectors-easier-to-access" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Crucial to give those with disabilities equal access to web services, Nov 27</a>). </p>
<p>Improving accessibility for persons with disabilities (PWDs) is a key
priority under the Enabling Masterplan 2030. One of the goals is to enhance
access to information and services for PWDs. To achieve this, the Government
is committed to ensuring that all high-traffic government websites are
accessible by 2030.</p>
<p>The design of government digital services, which covers both websites
and applications, is guided by the Digital Service Standards, which incorporate
the globally recognised Web Content Accessibility Guidelines. These guidelines
outline best practices to ensure that web content is accessible to everyone,
including PWDs.</p>
<p>GovTech also supports government agencies through providing central diagnostic
tools and conducting regular independent usability checks on frequently
used digital services.</p>
<p>As Mr Cheng highlighted, non-government and commercial digital services
must similarly be designed to be accessible. To support this, we have been
engaging private sector stakeholders and community partners to raise awareness
and share knowledge on digital accessibility.</p>
<p>For example, in May this year, GovTech launched the Co-Creation Lab, which
brought together more than 90 representatives from government agencies,
private sector organisations, and community users, including seniors and
PWDs.</p>
<p>This collaborative dialogue not only deepened the product teams’ understanding
of diverse user needs, but also provided valuable insights that will guide
the development of current and future digital services across both the
public and private sectors.</p>
<p>GovTech also developed Oobee, an open-source web accessibility testing
tool available free of charge to help organisations identify and resolve
website accessibility issues.</p>
<p>We will continue to build on these efforts and actively collaborate with
the private sector and community partners, including educational and healthcare
organisations, to promote inclusive practices to make non-government digital
services accessible to all citizens. We strongly encourage all stakeholders
to build a more inclusive digital ecosystem that meets the needs of all
users, including those with disabilities.</p>
