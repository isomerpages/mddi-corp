**Thank you for your feedback. The public consultation on the draft Postal Services (Amendment) Bill is now closed.**

================================================== 
  
**2 December 2020**  
  
**INTRODUCTION**  
  
1. The Ministry of Communications and Information&nbsp;**(MCI)** and the Infocomm Media Development Authority **(IMDA)** invite the public to provide feedback on the draft Postal Services (Amendment) Bill.

    **SCOPE OF CONSULTATION**

2. The Postal Services Act&nbsp;**(PSA)** is the legislative framework that governs the regulation of Singapore’s postal sector. Under the PSA, IMDA, as the appointed Postal Authority, has the powers to grant or modify licences, issue directions, codes of practice and standards of performance, amongst others, for the conveyance of letters weighing 500 grams or less. IMDA’s functions include ensuring that postal services are reasonably accessible to all people in Singapore and are supplied as efficiently and economically as practicable.  
  
3. MCI/IMDA is reviewing the PSA to address shifts in the market, such as the growth in e-commerce deliveries and ongoing developments in the postal landscape. These changes will ensure that the legislative framework for postal systems and services provided for under the PSA remains relevant and appropriate in the current environment, and continues to meet the social, industrial and commercial needs of Singapore.&nbsp;  
  
4. MCI/IMDA proposes two key areas of amendments:

     a) First, we intend to amend the PSA to **facilitate the deployment of the nationwide parcel locker network (Network)**. These include:

     i. Providing the Postal Authority with the powers to own and operate the Network at specified premises, and appoint a public parcel locker network operator to carry out the aforementioned functions.<br>
		 ii. Requiring building owners and developers of specified premises to provide space or facility and access thereto for the installation and operation of the Network.<br>
		 iii. Providing the Postal Authority with the powers to enforce and penalise offences relating to public parcel lockers deployed at specified premises.<br>
		 iv. Expanding the scope of the PSA in relation to the Network.
		 
    b) Second, we intend to **clarify and enhance IMDA’s regulatory oversight of the postal sector**. These include:
		
    i. Requiring the Public Postal Licensee **(PPL)** to provide wholesale access, and the Postal Authority to regulate such access, for delivery of non-letters to letter boxes.<br>
    ii. Extending the obligation of letter box provision and its maintenance to building owners, and empowering the Postal Authority to exempt any person/class of persons from letter box provision. <br>
    iii. Enhancing enforcement powers under the PSA.<br> 
    iv. Excluding messenger services and intra-organisation mailroom service (multiple premises) from the licensing framework.<br>
    v. Clarifying that the remittance of money and postage stamps are to be provided only by a designated PPL. <br>
    vi. Removing instances where the Postal Authority is required to publish a notice before an approved code of practice or standard of performance can take effect.

    **PERIOD OF CONSULTATION**  
  
5. The public consultation will run from 2 December to 23 December 2020.
