<p><strong>Closing Note to the Public Consultation on the Digital Enterprise Blueprint</strong>
</p>
<p>1. On 4 April 2024, the Ministry of Communications and Information published
a public consultation to seek further feedback from the public, industry,
and trade associations and chambers (TACs) on the Digital Enterprise Blueprint
(DEB). The public consultation closed on 22 April 2024. We appreciate the
feedback that has been submitted from various stakeholders across a wide
range of sectors.</p>
<p>2. The feedback received generally supported the four key shifts in the
DEB, which are:</p>
<p>a. To empower enterprises to be smarter in the way they work by leveraging
emerging technologies;</p>
<p>b. To support enterprises to scale faster through digital solutions;</p>
<p>c. To equip enterprises to be safer by improving their cyber resilience;
and</p>
<p>d. To continue investing in our workers as core enablers of digitalisation.</p>
<p><strong><u>Summary of Key Feedback</u></strong>
</p>
<p><em>Shift 1: To empower enterprises to be Smarter in the way they work</em>
</p>
<p>3. Most respondents recognised the potential of Artificial Intelligence
(AI) to help SMEs to be smarter in business operations and in staying competitive.
Some responses mentioned the challenges faced by SMEs, including a lack
of awareness and practical understanding of implementation of solutions
within existing business workflows. Others highlighted the need to increase
awareness and education of practical use cases and digital solutions that
are tailored to address the specific needs of enterprises, across different
sectors.</p>
<p><em>Shift 2: To support enterprises to scale faster through digital solutions</em>
</p>
<p>4. The responses acknowledged the strong potential of integrated digital
solutions for scaling businesses. Some respondents highlighted the efficiency
gains and additional benefits with the combination of digital technologies
like cloud and AI. There were suggestions for solutions to be more affordable
and easy-to-use, especially for non-technical staff, including low-code
or no-code platforms.</p>
<p><em>Shift 3: To equip enterprises to be safer by improving their cyber resilience</em>
</p>
<p>5. The responses recognised the importance of cyber resilience and agreed
with the recommendations outlined in the consultation paper. There was
common understanding that cybersecurity was a shared responsibility by
all, in bolstering the overall trust in the digital ecosystem. The feedback
indicated that there might be limited awareness of cyber threats among
many SMEs, as well as varying levels of cyber needs across industries.
There was a call for the government to raise awareness on cyber threats
to SMEs and initiatives available to them. Some respondents suggested for
industry-specific cybersecurity guidance, anonymised knowledge sharing
for data breaches, and the potential for Singapore-specific cyber standards.</p>
<p><em>Shift 4: To continue investing in our workers as core enablers of digitalisation</em>
</p>
<p>6. Respondents acknowledged the critical role of upskilling and reskilling
the workforce. There was a strong emphasis on the rapid evolution of skills
needed and the challenges faced by SMEs in this aspect, particularly their
hesitation to invest in training due to manpower constraints. The responses
highlighted the need for increased advocacy for and support in upskilling
non-technical staff, who play an important role in promoting in-house skill
development and culture of continuous improvement.</p>
<p><em>MCI’s preliminary response</em>
</p>
<p>7. We are aligned with respondents that embracing new technologies will
be crucial to helping SMEs stay ahead of the curve in an increasingly competitive
global environment. MCI recognises the importance of practical and easy-to-use
solutions in helping SMEs to optimise the way they work. For the broad
base of SMEs, IMDA’s CTO-as-a-Service (CTOaaS) provides access to resources
and digital consultants for tailored advice on solutions. At the sector-level,
we will progressively refresh our Industry Digital Plans (IDP) to include
an updated suite of solutions and incorporate sector-specific AI-enabled
solutions. We are also looking to include more integrated digital solutions
under the SMEs’ Go Digital program and curate more cloud-based solutions
to help our enterprises scale faster.</p>
<p>8. We agree with respondents that SMEs must continue to be supported in
raising their cyber resilience. Enterprises can tap on CSA’s Chief Information
Security Officer (CISO)-as-a-Service scheme to engage cybersecurity consultants
to develop tailored cybersecurity health plans. CSA’s Cyber Essentials
Mark is a cybersecurity certification designed to enable enterprises to
prioritise essential cybersecurity measures needed to safeguard their systems
and operations against common cyber-attacks.</p>
<p>9. We assure respondents that MCI, IMDA and CSA will continue to work
closely with TACs and industry partners in driving outreach and awareness
with SMEs, including on the digitalisation programmes and initiatives available
to SMEs, upskilling opportunities for their workforce, as well as on building
a supportive ecosystem for SMEs to thrive.</p>
<p><strong><u>Conclusion</u></strong>
</p>
<p>10. We thank all respondents for their valuable feedback and will take
these into consideration when finalising the Digital Enterprise Blueprint.</p>
