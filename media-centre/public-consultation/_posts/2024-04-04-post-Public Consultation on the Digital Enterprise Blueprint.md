next bound of digitalisation for enterprises, amidst a rapidly evolving
technological landscape and fast-growing digital economy.</p>
<p>3. In the process of developing the DEB, MCI has consulted extensively
with industry and trade association partners. With insights from the consultations

emerging technologies;</p>
<p>(b) Support enterprises to scale faster through digital solutions;</p>
<p>(c) Equip enterprises to be safer by improving their cyber resilience;
and</p>
<p>(d) Continue investing in our workers as core enablers of digitalisation.</p>
