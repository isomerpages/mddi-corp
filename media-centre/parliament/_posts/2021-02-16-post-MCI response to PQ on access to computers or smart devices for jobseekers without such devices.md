### Parliament Sitting on 16 February 2021

QUESTION FOR WRITTEN ANSWER
---------------------------

**  
12\. Dr Tan Wu Meng:** To ask the Minister for Communications and Information what avenues exist for jobseekers of limited means to access or own personal computing devices and resources so that jobseekers without computers or smart devices can update and edit personal curriculum vitae and resumes.  
  
**Answer:**  
  
1. The Government is committed to providing a baseline of affordable digital access to households of limited means, including households with jobseekers.   
   
2. Singapore is a highly connected society — 98% of resident households have access to broadband and own internet-enabled devices such as computers or smartphones. Programmes like IMDA’s Home Access support digital access for low income households through subsidised broadband, which may be bundled with a tablet. More than 21,000 households have benefited since the start of the programme in 2014, including close to 6,900 in the past year alone.   
  
3. In addition, access to computers and the Internet is available at public libraries island-wide for a nominal charge. Singaporeans and PRs aged 50 and above can enjoy 1 hour of free Internet access by logging in with their myLibrary ID.   
  
4. Jobseekers may also visit physical Career Matching Services touchpoints such as WSG’s and NTUC-e2i’s five physical career centres. Jobseekers can use computer terminals at these centres to update their personal curriculum vitae or submit job applications.
