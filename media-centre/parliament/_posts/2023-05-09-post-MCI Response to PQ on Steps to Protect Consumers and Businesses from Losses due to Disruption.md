### Parliament Sitting on 9 May 2023

QUESTION FOR WRITTEN ANSWER
---------------------------

**24\. Ms Hazel Poa:** To ask the Minister for Communications and Information (a) whether public and private organisations are liable for losses suffered by consumers and businesses as a result of disruptions to their digital services; and (b) if not, whether the Government will consider taking steps to protect consumers and businesses from losses due to such disruptions to digital services or impose minimum service standards on service providers.

**Answer: **

1. As with many types of services, liability for losses incurred due to disruptions of a digital service would be governed under (i) the terms of use for the service and/or (ii) the contractual agreement between buyer and seller.  
2. Where services have significant impact to our economy and society, regulatory agencies have also imposed minimum service standards. For example, the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) requires telecom operators and internet service providers to comply with Quality of Service (“QoS”) standards and audit requirements for network resilience. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has strict requirements for banks with regard to the resilience of their critical services, which include digital banking. These were detailed during the 21 April 2023 Parliament Sitting.
