<h3>Parliament Sitting on 12 November 2024</h3>
<h3>QUESTION FOR WRITTEN ANSWER</h3>
<p><strong>25. Ms See Jinli Jean</strong> asked the Minister for Digital Development
and Information (a) what is the Ministryâ€™s present steps and future plans
to train and involve the local creative practitioners in its goal of ensuring
that all high traffic Government websites will conform to the international
Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 at the AA level by 2030;
and (b) how is the Ministry encouraging the adoption of such accessibility
standards by digital spaces that are run by non-Governmental and private
sector entities.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
</p>
<p>The Government plans to make all high-traffic Government websites<sup>1</sup> accessible
by 2030. To do this, we will engage and work with local design practitioners
as needed. This includes getting feedback on the design of Government digital
services and organising workshops and trainings for design professionals.</p>
<p>We agree that non-Government entities should also improve the accessibility
of their digital services. The Government provides support in various ways.
For example, the Government Technology Agency (GovTech) has developed the
Oobee tool (previously known as Purple A11y), which is an open-source web
accessibility testing tool. This is freely available for use. GovTech has
also launched the Co-Creation Lab during the A11y week in May this year
which brought together representatives from Government agencies, the private
sector as well as community users to better understand accessibility-related
challenges. The first run of the Co-Creation Lab brought together 95 representatives
from the Government agencies and the private sector such as banks and e-commerce
firms, as well as users from the senior and Person-with-Disabilities (PWDs)
communities. This multi-stakeholder dialogue has enhanced product teams'
understanding of diverse user needs, including those of PWDs and seniors,
and yielded valuable insights that will directly inform the development
of current and future digital services from both the public and private
sectors.
<br>
<br>We will continue to build on these efforts and engage with the private
sector and community partners to raise awareness, facilitate knowledge
sharing and encourage efforts to make non-Government digital services accessible
to all Singaporeans.</p>
