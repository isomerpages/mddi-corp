<p><strong>OPENING SPEECH BY MINISTER OF STATE RAHAYU MAHZAM AT THE SECOND READING OF THE ELECTRONIC GAZETTE AND LEGISLATION BILL</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>SECOND READING OPENING SPEECH BY MINISTER OF STATE RAHAYU MAHZAM ON THE ELECTRONIC GAZETTE AND LEGISLATION BILL, 7 JAN 2025</strong>
</p>
<p>1. Mr Speaker, on behalf of the Minister for Digital Development and Information,
I move that the Bill be now read a second time.</p>
<p>2. Sir, the Government Gazette is the official public record of legislation,
appointments, and other official acts by the Government and other public
bodies. It is also used by private entities to issue notices in fulfilment
of statutory requirements. The Gazette is published by the Government Printer
on the authority of the Government or pursuant to statutory requirements.
In a way, one can think of the Gazette as a “public noticeboard”.</p>
<p>3. Digitalisation has transformed the manner through which we publish,
obtain and access information. The Gazette is no exception.</p>
<p>a. The electronic Gazette was first created in 1998. Today, it is published
every working day, while the print Gazette is published only once a week.
In other words, the electronic Gazette is published earlier and more frequently
than the print Gazette.</p>
<p>b. The electronic Gazette has become the main form of the Gazette used
by most of us today. From October to December 2024, the electronic Gazette
website saw a monthly average of over 8,000 unique visitors, whereas the
print Gazette only has 15 subscribers.</p>
<p>4. Recognising the public’s greater reliance on the electronic Gazette,
the Government has been leveraging digital technology to improve and enhance
the Gazette. In this regard, I am pleased to share with Members that we
rolled out a new electronic Gazette website last September, with significant
improvements in usability, reliability, security, and resilience.</p>
<p>5. The law must also move in tandem with the trend toward greater reliance
on the electronic Gazette.</p>
<p>a. Today, under section 48 of the Interpretation Act 1965, only the print
Gazette is authoritative, in the sense that only the print Gazette is prima
facie evidence of its contents. This status is not accorded to the electronic
Gazette.</p>
<p>b. This is not compatible with how the Gazette is published and used today.</p>
<p>6. Hence, the key objective of the Bill is to confer authoritative status
on the electronic Gazette, as well as electronic versions of revised editions
of legislation.</p>
<p>a. Similar to the Gazette, revised legislation can be published both in
print and electronically. Hence, even as we make the electronic Gazette
authoritative, we should also move in alignment to make electronic versions
of revised legislation authoritative.</p>
<p>b. We are also taking the opportunity to make related amendments to other
aspects of the law relating to the Gazette.</p>
<p>7. Let me now take Members through the Bill.</p>
<p>8. <strong>Clause 2 </strong>replaces the current section 48 of the Interpretation
Act 1965 with a new section 48. The key effect of the new section 48 is
to accord authoritative status to the electronic Gazette in the following
ways:</p>
<p>a. <u>First</u>, electronic Gazettes published on the prescribed website
will be treated as prima facie evidence of the matters published within.</p>
<p>b. <u>Second</u>, to the extent of any inconsistency, the electronic Gazette
will prevail over all other versions of the Gazette.</p>
<p>c. <u>Third</u>, the courts will be required to take judicial notice of
the electronic Gazette, in addition to the print Gazette. This means that
both print and electronic Gazettes need not be formally proved before they
can be relied on in court.</p>
<p>9. Taken together, this means that, going forward, the electronic Gazette
will be the authoritative version of the Gazette. Users can therefore rely
on the electronic Gazette with confidence.</p>
<p>a. Other existing provisions relating to the Gazette are also consolidated
in the new section 48.</p>
<p>10. <strong>Clause 3 </strong>amends various sections of the Revised Editions
of the Laws Act 1983.</p>
<p>a. A new section 17A will provide for electronic versions of revised legislation
to prevail over print versions, to the extent of any inconsistency. This
is in line with what we are doing for the electronic Gazette.</p>
<p>b. The amendments will also do away with the outdated requirement for
revised legislation to be published in print before they can be published
electronically.</p>
<p>c. In addition, Clause 3 will delete provisions and language that are
peculiar to print versions of revised legislation, or premised on the primacy
of such printed versions.</p>
<p>11. <strong>Clause 4</strong> amends various Acts to abolish the use of
the Gazette as an instrument of statutory appointment.</p>
<p>a. Today, various Acts require that statutory appointments be made via
Gazette notifications. However, the use of the Gazette in such a manner
is inconsistent with its function as a public record. Hence, clause 4 will
amend the relevant Acts to cease the use of the Gazette to make statutory
appointments. Going forward, these statutory appointments will be made
via other means, such as the issuance of an appointment letter.</p>
<p>b. Nonetheless, these statutory appointments are often of public interest.
Hence, clause 4 will generally impose requirements for these statutory
appointments to be published in the Gazette. The new requirements are directory
in nature, and are not meant to affect the validity of the appointments.</p>
<p>12. <strong>Clause 5</strong> makes amendments to various Acts where references
are made to materials printed by the Government Printer. As these materials
could be published electronically in the electronic Gazette as well, the
references are amended accordingly. Other consequential and related amendments
are also made.</p>
<p>13. In conclusion, the Bill will bring the law in line with the digital
age, and enable the public to rely on the electronic Gazette and electronic
legislation with greater confidence. Sir, I beg to move.</p>
