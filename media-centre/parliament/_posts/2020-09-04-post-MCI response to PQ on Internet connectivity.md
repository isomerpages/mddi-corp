### Parliament Sitting on 4 September 2020

QUESTION FOR WRITTEN ANSWER
---------------------------

  
**39. Mr Chong Kee Hiong:** To ask the Minister for Communications and Information how will the Ministry enhance internet connectivity islandwide and ensure that our connections remain secure and robust especially when work-from-home becomes more prevalent.   
  
**Answer:**

1. Singapore’s digital infrastructure has been able to accommodate the rise in Internet traffic arising from COVID-19.  Traffic volume remains well within each telecom operator’s network capacity, with a healthy buffer of at least 30%.  
  
2. IMDA has also put in place measures to minimise the risk of network disruptions, and ensure a speedy recovery if such disruptions were to occur.  For example, IMDA requires key telecom operators to conduct regular audits to ensure that the resilience of their networks is on par with international best practices.  IMDA also requires telecom operators to comply with requirements in areas such as redundancy and diversity.  The Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA) also requires telecom operators that own Critical Information Infrastructure to adhere to mandatory cybersecurity requirements prescribed under the Cybersecurity Act.   
  
3. MCI and IMDA continue to enhance our digital infrastructure for the next bound of growth in our digital economy.  For example, we are working with our telecom operators to deploy world-class nationwide 5G networks that are secure and resilient.   
  
4. In parallel, the Government is also taking steps to better protect Singaporeans and our enterprises against cyber threats.  CSA will launch the Safer Cyberspace Masterplan later this year, to secure our core digital infrastructure and safeguard our cyberspace.  Earlier in March, CSA also released an advisory that provides tips for individuals to stay cyber-safe while telecommuting; for example, by using a secure Wi-Fi network, and sending important and sensitive information over a Virtual Private Network.
