<h3>Parliament Sitting on 6 March 2024</h3>
<h3>QUESTION FOR WRITTEN ANSWER</h3>
<p><strong>28. Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis: </strong>To ask the Minister for
Communications and Information (a) what are the quantitative and qualitative
Universal Service Obligations set by IMDA for SingPost, including the provision
and maintenance of posting boxes and post offices throughout Singapore;
and (b) following SingPost’s completion of its strategic review, whether
IMDA’s Universal Service Obligations and Quality of Service standards are
expected to be lowered.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>1. As the Public Postal Licensee, SingPost is required to deliver letters
to every addressable place in Singapore, provide and maintain a network
of posting boxes and post offices to serve postal needs, and meet the Quality
of Service (or QoS) standards for letter delivery.</p>
<p>2. These obligations and standards have not changed as a result of SingPost’s
strategic review of its business. SingPost must continue to provide sufficient
postal services through its network of postal touchpoints and postal agents.</p>
<p>3. However, as explained in previous PQ responses, IMDA is working with
SingPost to review the existing requirements for post offices and posting
boxes as it transforms.</p>
<p>4. In doing so, we will (i) take into account the adequacy of SingPost’s
plans for alternative touchpoints and service models, and (ii) ensure that
regulatory requirements are relevant in the context of the changing post
and parcel landscape. We will share more details in due course.</p>
