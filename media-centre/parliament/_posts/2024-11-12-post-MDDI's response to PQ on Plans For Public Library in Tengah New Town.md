<h3>Parliament Sitting on 12 November 2024</h3>
<h3>QUESTION FOR WRITTEN ANSWER</h3>
<p><strong>*23. Mr Leong Mun Wai</strong> asked the Minister for Digital Development
and Information whether the National Library Board has plans for a public
library in Tengah New Town and, if so, where is the planned location and
when will it be completed.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
</p>
<p>The National Library Board (NLB) has worked with the Urban Redevelopment
Authority and the Housing and Development Board to ensure the future provision
of a library as part of the land use plans for Tengah New Town. When planning
for a library, NLB considers factors such as resident population size and
convenience of location, including, but not limited to, the site's proximity
to transport nodes and the town centre. However, as the plan for the new
town is still taking shape, we are unable to confirm the location and completion
date at this juncture.</p>
