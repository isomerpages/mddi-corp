<h3>Parliament Sitting on 7 January 2025</h3>
<h3>QUESTIONS FOR ORAL ANSWERS</h3>
<p><strong>*54. Ms Foo Mee Har</strong> asked the Minister for Digital Development
and Information in light of the Australian Government’s recent move to
ban social media access for individuals under the age of 16 through legislation
(a) what is the Government’s current assessment of the effectiveness of
such bans in protecting young users from online harms; and (b) whether
the Government has plans to consider similar measures, or alternative regulatory
approaches, to further safeguard children and teenagers on social media
platforms in Singapore.
<br>
<br><strong>*86.</strong>  <strong>Mr Pritam Singh</strong> asked the Minister
for Digital Development and Information (a) whether the Government assesses
that there are more advantages as opposed to disadvantages in legislating
for an age-limit on the use of social media access by young children and
teenagers; and (b) if not, why not.
<br>
<br><strong>*98.</strong>  <strong>Mr Saktiandi Supaat</strong> asked the Minister
for Digital Development and Information in light of Australia’s recent
move to ban social media for children under 16 and Albania’s announcement
to shut down TikTok for at least a year, whether the Ministry is considering
complementing the existing educational and counselling toolkit with regulatory
interventions, such as requiring social media platforms to customise age-appropriate
versions of their content for Singaporean children and teenagers.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
</p>
<p>Mr Speaker, may I have your permission to address PQ 6959 and PQ 7047
scheduled for today’s sitting and PQ 7078 scheduled for tomorrow’s sitting
together.</p>
<p>The stated objective of legislating age limits for social media access
is to protect children and youths from its harms. We share the same objective
and will continue to study the effectiveness of mandating age limits. For
example, how will the authorities assess the extent of violation? Where
will the line be drawn if younger users turn to accessing unregulated platforms
or services? We are engaging our Australian counterparts and social media
platforms to understand their views. This will help inform our thinking
on the next steps.</p>
<p>In the meantime, we have taken several steps to protect our children on
social media. In 2023, we introduced the Code of Practice for Online Safety.
It requires designated social media services to put in place measures to
enhance the safety of Singapore users, including more stringent measures
for children. Among other obligations, they must ensure children are not
targeted to receive content that is detrimental to their physical or mental
well-being. They must also have more restrictive account settings for children
and provide tools for parents to manage their safety.</p>
<p>We have also taken decisive steps to require the implementation of age
assurance methods, which have grown in availability and effectiveness,
and can help to minimise children’s access to harmful online content. Such
methods include age estimation using technology and age verification based
on submission of official documents. Our upcoming Code of Practice for
Online Safety for App Distribution Services will require designated App
Stores to put in place such measures to ensure that children access only
apps that are appropriate for their age.</p>
<p>Even as we consider further steps to improve protection for children online,
we are mindful that research findings on the impact of social media on
children are not conclusive. While it has been linked to mental health
issues, social media has also been shown to help children develop social
skills and build connections with their peers.</p>
<p>This is why we have stepped up complementary efforts in public education
to equip and educate parents and children on how to be safe online. We
do this through Cyber Wellness lessons in the Ministry of Education’s Character
and Citizenship Education (CCE) curriculum, as well as various initiatives
such as Parenting for Wellness launched in 2024 by the Ministry of Education,
the Ministry of Social and Family Development, and the Health Promotion
Board, and the Online Safety Digital Resource Kit on IMDA’s Digital for
Life (DfL) portal. These are complemented by efforts of industry and community
partners, such as Google’s Be Internet Awesome Programme and Touch Community
Services’ First Device Campaign.</p>
<p>We are constantly looking to do better, and I welcome Members and everyone’s
suggestions. Ensuring online safety is a whole of society effort, and everyone
can play their part.</p>
