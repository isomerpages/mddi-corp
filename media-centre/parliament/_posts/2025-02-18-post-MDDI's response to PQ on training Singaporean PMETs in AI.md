<h3>Parliament Sitting on 18 February 2025</h3>
<h3>QUESTION FOR ORAL ANSWER</h3>
<p><strong>*8. Mr Gan Thiam Poh</strong> asked the Minister for Digital Development
and Information whether the Ministry will consider providing more training
to Singaporean professionals, managers, executives and technicians (PMETs)
so as to increase the pool of PMETS who have capabilities in artificial
intelligence and to strengthen our competitive position.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
</p>
<p>The Government’s approach for training our workers, including professionals,
managers, executives and technicians, or PMETs, in artificial intelligence,
was laid out in MDDI’s responses to similar PQs filed by MP Gerald Giam

2024 and 13 November 2024 Parliament sittings respectively.</p>
