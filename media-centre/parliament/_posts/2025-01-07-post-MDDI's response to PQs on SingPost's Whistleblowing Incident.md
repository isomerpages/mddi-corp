<h3>Parliament Sitting on 7 January 2025</h3>
<h3>QUESTION FOR ORAL ANSWER</h3>
<p><strong>*43. Mr Saktiandi Supaat:</strong> To ask the Minister for Digital
Development and Information (a) whether the Ministry is aware of any manual
manipulation of delivery status codes for any parcel deliveries within
Singapore; (b) what further actions, investigations or audits have the
Ministry or the Infocomm Media Development Authority ordered SingPost to
conduct; and (c) considering the important role that postal delivery plays
for the service of legal notices and court papers, how can trust be preserved
in the reliability of postal services.</p>
<p><strong>*74. Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis:</strong> To ask the Minister of Digital
Development and Information in light of the whistleblowing report received
by Singapore post relating to its internal e-commerce logistics parcel
business which was also sent to the IMDA, whether the Government will (i)
conduct further comprehensive reviews of the company to identify any non-compliance
matters, including with IMDA's Universal Service Obligations and Quality
of Service standards for postal service and (ii) relook its fundamental
review of the postal sector.</p>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>
</p>
<p>1. Mr Speaker, may I have your permission to address Question Nos 43 and
74 for Oral Answer in today's Order Paper? Mr Speaker, my response today
will also cover the questions filed by Dr Tan Wu Meng, Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul
Rahim and Mr Pritam Singh for a subsequent Sitting. If the Members are
satisfied with the response, they may wish to withdraw the questions after
this session.</p>
<p>2. I will answer the following questions raised by Members. First, what
is the substance of the whistleblowing report? Second, are domestic postal
services affected? Third, does this affect the review of postal services?</p>
<p>3. First, what is the substance of the whistleblowing report? The report
concerned the alleged falsification of e-commerce shipment data for SingPost’s
customer.</p>
<p>4. IMDA had assessed and was satisfied that the incident was confined
to international transshipment parcel delivery overseas, and did not affect
regulated domestic postal services. This is a matter of corporate governance,
which the SingPost Board is dealing with.</p>
<p>5. Second, are domestic postal services affected? As mentioned, the answer
is no. SingPost’s Board has assured the Government that postal service
operations are not affected. Nonetheless, IMDA will continue to keep a
close watch to uphold the public’s interests. As the Public Postal Licensee
(or PPL), we expect SingPost to meet its obligations for its regulated
postal business. These include ensuring that domestic letter delivery meets
IMDA’s Quality of Service (or QoS) standards. SingPost’s QoS performance
is independently audited and the results are published on IMDA’s website.
Over the last four years, SingPost has performed within QoS standards.</p>
<p>6. I would also assure Mr Saktiandi Supaat that postal services for legal
notices and court orders are not affected.</p>
<p>7. While the whistleblowing report did not affect regulated domestic postal
services, we were concerned, as Dr Tan was, about simultaneous dismissals
of senior executives in a firm providing essential postal services. Hence,
IMDA had issued SingPost an advisory to uphold proper corporate governance
and processes, given its PPL status.</p>
<p>8. Third, on Mr Pritam Singh’s and Mr Louis Chua’s questions on how this
affects the postal sector review, the answer is that it has not and the
review is ongoing. IMDA will continue to work closely with the CEO of SingPost’s
Singapore Business Unit, who remains in the role. Our postal services have
to transform to remain sustainable and accessible, while safeguarding the
interests of the public and postal workers.</p>
