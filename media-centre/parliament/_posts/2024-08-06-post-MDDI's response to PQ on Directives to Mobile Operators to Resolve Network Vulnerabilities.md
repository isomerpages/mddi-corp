<h3>Parliament Sitting on 6 August 2024</h3>
<h3>QUESTION FOR WRITTEN ANSWER</h3>
<p><strong>36. Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song</strong> asked the Minister for Digital
Development and Information whether IMDA has issued any directives to mobile
operators to (i) remove the Signalling System 7 (SS7) and Diameter protocols
from their networks to prevent cyber attackers from using SS7- and Diameter-based
location and monitoring exploits and (ii) resolve vulnerabilities related
to SS7- and Diameter-based location and monitoring exploits.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
</p>
<p>The Signalling System 7 (SS7) and Diameter protocols are standard international
telecommunication network signalling protocols used in 3G and 4G mobile
networks respectively. They are used by mobile operators who connect to
each other for functions such as the setting up of calls, and routing of
SMSes. While there are known vulnerabilities with these protocols, there
are no alternative protocols in 3G and 4G networks which are more secure
and approved by international standard bodies, such as 3rd Generation Partnership
Project (3GPP) and European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI).</p>
<p>Mobile operators are required to put in place measures to secure their
networks, including against vulnerabilities inherent in the SS7 and Diameter
protocols. To address the vulnerabilities of these older protocols, mobile
operators have implemented measures such as specialised firewalls and system
safeguards to ensure early detection of suspicious network activities and
blocking any unauthorised access detected. They have also implemented further
control measures to secure their connections with other mobile networks
such as through the use of network encryption. These measures are aligned
with international standards development organisations such as Global System
for Mobile Communications Association (GSMA).</p>
<p>These older protocols are no longer adopted in 5G mobile networks where
more secure protocols have been implemented, which overcome the inherent
vulnerabilities of older protocols by design.</p>
