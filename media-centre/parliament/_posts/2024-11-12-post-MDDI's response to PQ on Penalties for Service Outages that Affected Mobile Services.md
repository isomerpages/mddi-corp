<h3>Parliament Sitting on 12 November 2024</h3>
<h3>QUESTION FOR ORAL ANSWER</h3>
<p><strong>*41. Mr Saktiandi Supaat </strong>asked the Minister for Digital
Development and Information (a) whether the authorities are looking into
the service outages that affected mobile network, broadband Internet and
subscription television services in 2024 and consider imposing penalties
on service operators when they do not meet the expected service standards;
and (b) whether regulatory supervision will be tightened in light of these
service outages.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
</p>
<p>The Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) is investigating recent
disruptions to mobile, broadband and subscription television services.
Preliminary findings suggest that the disruptions were caused by technical
issues. There is no evidence of sabotage or cyber attacks.</p>
<p>My Ministry recognises the increasing importance of digital services to
the day-to-day activities of consumers and businesses, and the significant
impact when disruptions occur. Under the Telecommunications Act and Broadcasting
Act, key telecommunications and broadcast service operators are required
to put in place robust measures to minimise service disruptions. Operators
are held to high levels of service standards in line with international
benchmarks. They are required to conduct regular audits and reviews of
their network infrastructure and business continuity plans to ensure the
resilience of their services.</p>
<p>I would like to assure the House that all service disruptions are taken
seriously. Should IMDAâ€™s investigations reveal lapses on the part of operators,
firm action will be taken against them, including the imposition of financial
penalties and directions to undertake the necessary measures to remedy
gaps found.</p>
<p>While every effort should be made to minimise service disruptions, we
should plan on the basis that they will not be eliminated. This is especially
so given the increasing scale, functionality and complexity of digital
systems. The Government will regularly review our regulations for relevance
and effectiveness. At the same time, businesses should consider stepping
up resilience measures to minimise inconvenience to their customers when
disruptions occur.</p>
