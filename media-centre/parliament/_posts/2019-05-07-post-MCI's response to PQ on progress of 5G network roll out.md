### Parliament Sitting on 7 May 2019

QUESTION FOR ORAL ANSWER
------------------------

**\*2829. Mr Ang Wei Neng:** To ask the Minister for Communications and Information what is the progress of rolling out a 5G network in Singapore.  
  
**Answer:**  
  
1. 5G technology and networks will be a critical part of Singapore’s Digital Economy.  I announced at the Committee of Supply debates earlier this year that we plan to commence the roll out of 5G mobile networks by 2020.  We are on track to achieve this target.  Today, the Info-communications Media Development Authority, or IMDA, launched a public consultation on the appropriate regulatory framework, spectrum allocation and other policies associated with 5G.   
  
2. To further differentiate Singapore’s 5G strategy, we also aim to advance innovation in secure 5G applications and services in tandem with our 5G network deployment process.  One important aspect of this is developing key 5G use-cases, especially for enterprise applications, that we can potentially export to the rest of the world.  IMDA has been leading this effort, engaging industry players and Government agencies in early trials and test-bedding.   
  
3. The feedback gained through IMDA’s public consultation will inform our policies to facilitate the 5G network rollout, and help identify innovative and impactful 5G applications.  I encourage all industry players and other stakeholders to actively participate in this consultation.
