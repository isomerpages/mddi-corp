<h3>Parliament Sitting on 7 May 2024</h3>
<h3>QUESTION FOR WRITTEN ANSWER</h3>
<p></p>
<p><strong>38.</strong>  <strong>Mr Christopher de Souza </strong>asked the
Minister for Communications and Information how does the Cyber Security
Agency intend to increase the public uptake in installing anti-virus apps
on their personal devices to decrease the chances of such devices being
infected by malware.</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p>Cybersecurity apps, which include anti-virus apps, help to protect mobile
devices against malware and phishing attacks. The Cyber Security Agency
(CSA) has been encouraging users of mobile devices to install cybersecurity
apps on their devices in its public education initiatives. According to
CSA’s 2022 Cybersecurity Public Awareness Survey, five in ten persons installed
cybersecurity apps, an increase from four in ten persons in 2020.</p>
<p>To help the public choose suitable cybersecurity apps based on their needs
and budget, CSA published a list of recommended cybersecurity apps. This
list has been available since September 2023 and has been publicised through
various Government outreach initiatives. For example, CSA works through
SG Digital Office’s Digital Ambassadors to share the list with seniors
at community centres and digital community hubs and to install cybersecurity
apps on their mobile devices upon request. CSA has received positive feedback
from members of public that they found the list useful.</p>
<p>CSA has also been working with industry players to better protect Singaporeans
and their mobile devices from potential malware infections. For example,
Google and CSA launched a pilot programme in Feb 2024, in which Google
Play Protect will block the installation of apps that are likely to be
malicious, as an added layer of protection for Android mobile users. Last
year, CSA also worked with our major retail banks to implement anti-malware
security measures on their banking apps to better protect their customers
against malware-enabled scams.</p>
<p>As malicious actors’ malware techniques are constantly evolving, CSA’s
efforts must be complemented by users’ vigilance. They should proactively
install cybersecurity apps in their personal devices and adopt good cyber
hygiene practices such as not downloading apps or files from unknown persons
or entities.
