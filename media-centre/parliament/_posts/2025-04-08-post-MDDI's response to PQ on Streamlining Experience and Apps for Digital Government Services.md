<h3>Parliament Sitting on 8 April 2025</h3>
<h3>QUESTION FOR WRITTEN ANSWER</h3>
<p><strong>37.</strong>  <strong>Mr Christopher de Souza </strong>asked the
Minister for Digital Development and Information what measures are being
considered to streamline the overall experience for digital Government
services in Singapore, in light of the number of apps pertaining to Government
digital services available today, which may be difficult for seniors and
the less digitally-savvy to navigate.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
</p>
<p>The Government is committed to ensuring that digital Government services
are easy to navigate and use for all citizens, including seniors and the
less digitally savvy.</p>
<p>When designing these services, we consider citizens’ needs and habits.
Citizens may access these services through searching online or via agency-provided
links. Some may prefer to use their computers, while some prefer to use
apps on their smartphones as they are frequently on the go. Providing different
channels facilitates discoverability and ease of access.</p>
<p>Where it makes sense, we will bring together different digital services
to make it more convenient for citizens. Examples include LifeSG and HealthHub.
However, having too many services on a single app or website can lead to
clutter and make it harder to find the right service.</p>
<p>We recognise that despite our best efforts, there will be citizens who
need in-person support and this is why we provide such assistance at Government
agencies’ physical touchpoints and ServiceSG Centres.</p>
