<h3>Parliament Sitting on 8 January 2025</h3>
<h3>QUESTION FOR ORAL ANSWER</h3>
<p><strong>*62. Mr Saktiandi Supaat </strong>asked the Minister for Digital
Development and Information in light of Australia’s recent move to ban
social media for children under 16 and Albania’s announcement to shut down
TikTok for at least a year, whether the Ministry is considering complementing
the existing educational and counselling toolkit with regulatory interventions,
such as requiring social media platforms to customise age-appropriate versions
of their content for Singaporean children and teenagers.</p>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>
</p>
<p>I thank Mr Saktiandi for his question, which I have answered in the reply
to the Parliamentary Questions filed by Ms Foo Mee Har and Mr Pritam Singh
at the Sitting of 7 January 2025. I invite him to seek clarification, if
any, on my reply.</p>
