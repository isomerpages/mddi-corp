### Parliament Sitting on 4 April 2022

QUESTION FOR WRITTEN ANSWER
------------------------------------
**40.Dr Tan Wu Meng:** To ask the Minister for Communications and Information how many households, broken down by the different categories of housing type, still have a landline telephone connection which is (i) an analogue line and (ii) connected via optical network terminal or other home digital line, respectively.

**Answer:**

1. There are about 1.2 million residential fixed-line telephony service subscriptions in Singapore. Of these, close to 1 million were subscribed to digital telephony services. Analogue fixed-line telephony subscriptions are declining as telecommunications operators continue to upgrade their networks. The distribution of all fixed-line subscribers by housing types broadly mirrors that of the households. We do not have a further breakdown according to the type of fixed-line service.
