<h3>Parliament Sitting on 2 July 2024</h3>
<h3>QUESTION FOR ORAL ANSWER</h3>
<p><strong>*107. Mr Edward Chia Bing Hui</strong> asked the Minister for Communications
and Information whether there are any plans to introduce stricter regulations
on social media platforms to protect children from potential addiction
and harmful content.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
</p>
<p>The Singapore Government strongly believes in protecting our citizens,
especially children, from harmful online content and potential addiction.
In this regard, regulation plays an important role.</p>
<p>On online harms, we have taken a targeted approach. Under the Broadcasting
Act, the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) has designated six
Social Media Services (SMSs) with significant reach or impact in Singapore.
They are Facebook, HardwareZone, Instagram, TikTok, X (formerly Twitter),
and YouTube. These SMSs are required to comply with the Code of Practice
for Online Safety (Online Safety Code), which took effect on 18 July 2023.
The Online Safety Code requires designated SMSs to have in place additional
measures to enhance the online safety of children. These include ensuring
that children are not targeted to receive content that SMSs are reasonably
aware to be detrimental to their physical or mental well-being, having
in place more restrictive account settings for children, and providing
tools for children or their parents to manage their safety.</p>
<p>Designated SMSs are due to submit their first online safety compliance
reports by end-July 2024, and we will evaluate their compliance with the
Online Safety Code before assessing if there is a need to tighten any requirements.
Age assurance remains one of our key considerations in ensuring the online
safety of children. While most major social media services require users
to be at least 13 years old, they rely primarily on usersâ€™ self-declaration.
With the growing availability of age assurance methods, we are seriously
studying how the industry can do more on this front to better protect children
online.</p>
<p>Excessive use of social media is also a key concern associated with anxiety,
depression, insomnia, and stress. These associations are linked to the
duration, frequency, and number of social media platforms being used. It
is as yet unclear if putting warning labels on social media platforms,
on its own, will be effective in curbing excessive use. We have instead
adopted a more holistic strategy which includes educating and providing
stronger support to parents and children.</p>
<p>For parents who suspect that their children may have developed dependency
on social media, they can seek help from community service providers such
as TOUCH Community Services, which runs counselling and intervention programmes
for affected youths. Alternatively, parents can tap on specialised services
such as the National Addictions Management Service (NAMS) for assessment
and intervention.</p>
<p>We also recognise that it is important to go upstream to provide support
and create awareness amongst parents early, even before the child is born.
Prevention is better than cure. In this regard, the Government is committed
to taking more decisive and effective measures to shape the habit of device
usage. The Ministry of Health (MOH) and Ministry of Social and Family Development
(MSF) oversee the key touch points for children up to six years old, through
child and maternity care, and pre-schools. They intend to make their advice
on device usage and screen time clearer and more definitive, and to deliver
them consistently across all healthcare settings, with more reminders.
They can put such advice into practice in pre-schools and encourage their
adoption at home. MOH and MSF will finalise and announce these initiatives
in the coming months. At the same time, Ministry of Communications and
Information is working with MOH and MSF to strengthen safeguards where
practical.</p>
