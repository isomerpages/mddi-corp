<h3>Parliament Sitting on 9 January 2024</h3>
<h3>QUESTION FOR WRITTEN ANSWER</h3>
<p><strong>52. Mr Yip Hon Weng: </strong>To ask the Minister for Communications
and Information (a) what are the reasons for the ongoing restriction of
dialects on free-to-air (FTA) radio and television; and (b) considering
the elderly’s potentially limited access to pay TV and internet for entertainment,
whether the Ministry will consider fully lifting the dialect usage restrictions
for FTA services.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Mr Speaker, the Government’s longstanding policy is to promote the use
of Mandarin as one of our four official languages. Free-to-Air (FTA) TV
and radio cater to a wide range of audiences and are therefore required
to offer Chinese services in Mandarin.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nonetheless, dialect content remains available. Mediacorp’s Channel 8
provides a dedicated belt of dialect programmes every Friday morning. Its
radio station Capital 95.8FM offers daily news bulletins in various dialects.
Dialect is also allowed for operatic performances or when the Mandarin
terms are not commonly used. Dialect content is available on other platforms
as well, such as Mediacorp’s meWATCH, online platforms like YouTube, videos
and music albums in retail stores, as well as through outdoor and theatrical
performances. &nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are currently no plans to allow more dialect programmes on FTA TV
and radio. An MCI study in 2023 found that almost 7 in 10 respondents chose
Mandarin as the language that they can read or listen in. A very small
number chose dialect exclusively. In addition, more than half of the respondents
across all age groups felt that the amount of dialect content on FTA TV
and radio should remain at the current level.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That said, we will continue to monitor Singaporeans’ views and demand
towards dialect content and are prepared to lift the restrictions when
the need arises, such as during the Covid-19 pandemic to facilitate health-related
information dissemination.</p>
</li>
</ol>
