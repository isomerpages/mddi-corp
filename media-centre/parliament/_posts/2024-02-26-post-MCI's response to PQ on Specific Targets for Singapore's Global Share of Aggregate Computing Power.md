<h3>Parliament Sitting on 26 February 2024</h3>
<h3>QUESTION FOR ORAL ANSWER</h3>
<p><strong>4. Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song: </strong>To ask the Minister for
Communications and Information (a) whether the Government has set specific
targets for Singapore's global share of aggregate computing power over
the next five to 10 years; (b) if so, what is this target share and by
when; (c) which agency is responsible for this initiative; and (d) what
interim milestones will the Government use to track progress.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
</p>
<p>No such target has been set. The amount of compute resources in Singapore
depends on the workloads that the private and public sectors expect to
process, and how these workloads are distributed. It changes dynamically
in response to needs and available alternatives.</p>
