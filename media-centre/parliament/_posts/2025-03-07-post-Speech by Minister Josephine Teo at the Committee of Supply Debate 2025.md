<p>1. Mr Chairman, I thank members for their cuts.</p>
<p>2. Last year, Prime Minister launched Smart Nation 2.0 – a refresh of
our vision for Singapore to use technology to uplift the lives of our people.
Today, I will elaborate on our efforts in four areas:</p>
<p>a. How we support our workforce to succeed in the age of AI;</p>
<p>b. How we keep Singaporeans safe by fighting harmful online activities;</p>
<p>c. How we protect our cyberspace against malicious attacks; and</p>
<p>d. How we preserve trust in our infospace by strengthening public service
media.</p>
<p>3. Mr Chairman, may I ask the Clerks to distribute the package of handouts?
Thank you. Members may also access these materials through the MP@SGPARL
App.</p>
<p><strong><u>Strengthening the AI Competencies of Our Workforce</u></strong>
</p>
<p>4. Sir, in this year’s Budget and COS debates, Members spoke often about
AI. Ms Jessica Tan, Ms Rachel Ong, and Mr Sharael Taha also raised concerns
about its impact on workers.</p>
<p>5. I understand these concerns. They are real and will be with us for
some time, because we are only at the very early stages of AI adoption
globally.</p>
<p>6. People all over the world would like to know who will be impacted and
how. While there is no perfect clarity, there are ways in which we can
help.</p>
<p>7. The first is to recognise that many jobs will still be around. The
risk is not that these jobs will be lost to AI, but that they are lost
to another country or city that is more competitive than us.</p>
<p>8. Our most important task therefore is to help as many people and businesses
as we can become more productive, with the use of AI.</p>
<p>a. We want to become a nation of competent and confident AI users.</p>
<p>b. In doing so, we can maintain Singapore’s economic competitiveness and
retain more good jobs here.</p>
<p>9. Sir, I have compiled a list of comparisons by various organisations
in Handout C1.</p>
<p>a. Members will see that Singapore is well regarded and well-placed to
benefit from widespread AI adoption.</p>
<p>b. We should capitalise on this opportunity.</p>
<p>10. We have established strong partnerships with tech companies like Amazon
Web Services, Databricks, Google and Oracle. For example, Microsoft has
partnered with NTUC Learning Hub to train up to 100,000 workers with AI
skills.</p>
<p>11. At the same time, IMDA is working with SkillsFuture Singapore to expand
the curriculum in SkillsFuture for Digital Workplace 2.0 to include AI
and Generative AI content.</p>
<p>a. Under this expansion, workers in all sectors – be it manufacturing
or retail - can learn how to use tools such as ChatGPT and CoPilot.</p>
<p>b. This will help them to enhance their productivity at work, even if
they have no background in tech.</p>
<p>12. The second thing we must recognise is that AI will create new jobs
even as it replaces some existing ones.</p>
<p>a. As members have highlighted, our next most important task is to deepen
our AI capabilities, and anchor more new jobs in Singapore.</p>
<p>b. This means growing our pool of AI practitioners, which includes data
scientists, machine learning engineers and more.</p>
<p>13. Take for example, the need for AI safety.</p>
<p>a. As AI adoption grows, there will be greater demand for AI testing and
assurance service providers, just as widespread IT adoption led to greater
demand for IT auditors.</p>
<p>b. Estimates of the market for such Testing, Inspection and Certification
services vary, but they would be in the billions in time to come.</p>
<p>14. Singapore believes in the importance of good AI governance.</p>
<p>a. We were one of the first in the world to introduce a testing framework
and software toolkit, AI Verify.</p>
<p>b. Just last month, I launched the Global AI Assurance Pilot of the AI
Verify Foundation to promote best practices in the testing of models using
Generative AI.</p>
<p>15. These efforts can help to grow the AI testing industry here and create
new jobs.</p>
<p>16. In response to Mr Sharael Taha and Ms Tin Pei Ling, let me provide
an update on efforts to expand our pool of AI Practitioners.</p>
<p>a. I previously shared our ambition to expand the pool from under 5,000
to 15,000 in about five years.</p>
<p>b. In the last year or so, we estimate that the pool has grown by nearly
25%.</p>
<p>17. The AI Centres of Excellence that MDDI and MTI work closely together
to set up will catalyse more demand for AI practitioners, by the hundreds
if not thousands. The public sector itself has growing needs. For example,
the Home Team Science &amp; Technology Agency is on track to hire and train
a 300-person AI workforce by end-2025.</p>
<p>18. To meet demand, we need to grow a strong pipeline of AI Practitioners.
To this end, we will expand our efforts under IMDA’s TechSkills Accelerator,
or TeSA.</p>
<p>a. We will provide more company-led training opportunities.</p>
<p>b. We will also explore ways to expand the AI Apprenticeship Programme
together with AI Singapore.</p>
<p>19. Let me share an example of how these programmes benefit Singaporeans.</p>
<p>a. Seow Yuxin studied business and started her career in Regional Operations
for an e-commerce platform.</p>
<p>b. She did not work on AI systems directly, but the role sparked her interest
in the field.</p>
<p>c. After seeing her husband and brother-in-law go through the AI Apprenticeship
Programme, she took a leap of faith and enrolled in the programme.</p>
<p>d. I spoke to Yuxin recently, and was pleased to learn that she has pivoted
to a new role in a new company delivering AI and data-driven solutions
to other organisations.</p>
<p>20. We are determined to keep AI opportunities open and inclusive.</p>
<p>a. Yuxin shows that one can access AI opportunities even without a STEM
background.</p>
<p>b. We will aim to support more Singaporeans like her to fulfil their AI
ambitions.</p>
<p>21. As a government, we will always put our people at the heart of all
that we do, and that includes our AI plans. I hope these efforts reassure
Members of our support for Singaporeans to make the most of AI.</p>
<p><strong><u>Strengthening Our Fight Against Harmful Online Activities</u></strong>
</p>
<p>22. Besides succeeding with AI, we want Singaporeans to feel safe when
they go online.</p>
<p>a. But this is not something the Government alone can achieve.</p>
<p>b. Social media platforms must do their part, no different from how all
service providers bear some responsibilities towards their users.</p>
<p>c. This is why we passed the Online Safety (Miscellaneous Amendments)
Act in 2022, to set out their basic obligations.</p>
<p>23. Like Mr Eric Chua, we believe in adopting a holistic and balanced
approach to online safety, particularly for young users. Where it is useful
to do so, we will strengthen regulatory levers.</p>
<p>a. For example, in January, we issued a new Code of Practice for Online
Safety for App Distribution Services.</p>
<p>b. For the first time, we are introducing measures to ensure that young
users under 18 do not access age-inappropriate apps.</p>
<p>24. Last month, we also published our first-ever Online Safety Assessment
Report.</p>
<p>a. To questions raised by Mr Xie Yao Quan, the report showed that the
designated social media services made good efforts to put in place baseline
user safety measures.</p>
<p>b. However, as he has also pointed out, there are areas for improvement.
They should respond more quickly to user reports. Their measures to protect
children from harmful content are also far from satisfactory.</p>
<p>25. This is why MDDI is studying whether the age assurance obligations
for app stores should also apply to social media services.</p>
<p>26. We also want to do more to support the victims of online harms.</p>
<p>a. IMDA’s report found that more often than not, platforms fail to take
action to remove genuinely harmful content reported to them by victims.</p>
<p>27. One such victim was Jane, and that is not her real name.</p>
<p>a. At 18, she was horrified to find an image of her face superimposed
onto another person’s nude body, circulating on an image sharing platform.</p>
<p>b. Strangers reposted the image and left comments, some of which sexualised
or insulted her.</p>
<p>c. When she reported this to the platform, they took down only the original
post, but not the reposts.</p>
<p>d. During this ordeal, she felt scared and embarrassed, even blaming herself
for posting photos online in the first place.</p>
<p>e. A full decade later, at 29 years old today, Jane continues to question
who created that photo of her, and if it is still found online.</p>
<p>28. Victims like Jane need more support to find closure.</p>
<p>29. During the Smart Nation 2.0 launch, PM announced that the Government
will introduce new legislation to support victims seeking relief from specified
online harms.</p>
<p>a. Ms Tin will be glad to know that the proposed law, the Online Safety
(Relief &amp; Accountability) Bill, will be introduced later this year.
It will establish a new agency, called the Online Safety Commission or
OSC, so that victims can get timely help if they encounter online harms.</p>
<p>b. The OSC will be set up by the first half of 2026. Victims will be able
to request the OSC to issue a direction to the platform to take down the
offensive content. The platform must also remove existing identical copies
on the platform, something they refused to do for Jane.</p>
<p>c. The new law will also help victims hold perpetrators accountable. If
they want to sue the perpetrators, they can request the OSC to direct the
platform to provide information about the perpetrators.</p>
<p>30. In drafting the new law, MinLaw and MDDI have engaged a wide range
of stakeholders from industry, academia, community groups, and international
partners. We also invited the public to provide their feedback.</p>
<p>a. The public consultation findings have been published on the website
of REACH.</p>
<p>b. We are heartened by the strong support and useful feedback which will
help refine our proposals.</p>
<p>31. Given the complexity and vastness of the digital space, rules and
regulations alone are insufficient. Everyone has a part to play, and Minister
of State Rahayu will share what citizens can do to protect themselves online.</p>
<p><strong><u>Strengthening our Cybersecurity Against Malicious Cyber Attacks</u></strong>
</p>
<p>32. Sir, in his Budget statement, PM talked about the global context being
more uncertain and having more downside risks.</p>
<p>33. This is reflected in the digital domain, where cyber threats have
become more severe.</p>
<p>a. Criminal groups are increasingly going online to look for illicit gains.</p>
<p>b. Advanced Persistent Threat actors linked to certain states are actively
seeking to advance their national agenda.</p>
<p>c. We have seen both kinds of activities in our cyberspace.</p>
<p>34. Last year, a global botnet, which included infected servers and devices
around the world, was discovered. More details can be found in Handout
B1.</p>
<p>a. Until CSA participated in an international operation to disrupt this
botnet, about 2,700 devices in Singapore had been infected, unbeknownst
to their owners.</p>
<p>b. The malicious actors exploited poor cyber hygiene practices to infect
devices including baby monitors and internet routers.</p>
<p>35. Members may ask, so what if the botnet had remained?</p>
<p>a. Well, it would have meant the devices were vulnerable, and personal
data belonging to device owners could have been stolen.</p>
<p>b. More worryingly, the devices could be used as a standby army, much
like our NSFs, ready to be deployed into active duty.</p>
<p>c. Except in this case, it would be foreign state-linked actors using
the bots for malicious purposes, which can include targets within Singapore.</p>
<p>36. As Ms Tin highlighted, international partnerships are critical in
combatting such complex threats. CSA could act only because it has recognised
capabilities and was trusted by its partners to be involved in this international
operation.</p>
<p>37. Botnets are just one of the many cyber threats we need to defend against.
This is why we emphasise the need to safeguard our cybersecurity at multiple
levels.</p>
<p>38. For individuals, we will continue working with industry partners to
offer better protection.</p>
<p>a. One example is the Enhanced Fraud Protection feature under Google Play
Protect.</p>
<p>b. A common scam tactic is to entice victims to download apps from unofficial
sources that can inject malware onto our devices. With this feature, such
download attempts on Android devices will be blocked.</p>
<p>39. For organisations, the Government is improving the SG Cyber Safe Programme.
Senior Minister of State Tan Kiat How will share more details later.</p>
<p>40. We also agree with Mr Sharael Taha on the need to raise our national
cyber security posture.</p>
<p>41. Last year, CSA amended the Cybersecurity Act to require that CII owners
report on a larger set of cyber incidents.</p>
<p>a. We also expanded CSA’s oversight beyond CIIs to other important systems
and entities, such as cloud services and data centres.</p>
<p>b. The amendments are expected to come into force later this year. More
information can be found in Handout B2.</p>
<p>42. Beyond cybersecurity, we aim to introduce a new Digital Infrastructure
Act to enhance security and resilience of digital infrastructure. Senior
Minister of State Janil Puthucheary will share more later.</p>
<p>43. What I worry about are the organisations that are not covered by such
legislation, that are not paying enough attention to cybersecurity.</p>
<p>a. Thankfully, over 500 organisations believe in the importance of cybersecurity
and have acted on it by getting their Cyber Essentials and Cyber Trust
Marks.</p>
<p>b. But we should raise baseline cybersecurity standards nationally and
protect more organisations, especially those of higher risk.</p>
<p>44. CSA is therefore assessing if more measures are needed, particularly
for vendors that may be given access to sensitive data or systems within
Government.</p>
<p>a. Such vendors include cybersecurity penetration testing firms, and cybersecurity
auditors.</p>
<p>b. Possible measures include requiring these vendors and their subcontractors
to obtain their Cyber Essentials or Cyber Trust Marks before they can be
licensed or bid for contracts offered by Government.</p>
<p>c. Government may also take the lead to incorporate cybersecurity considerations
in our procurement decisions.</p>
<p>d. As the impact of these measures may be non-trivial, CSA plans to engage
the industry before deciding.</p>
<p><strong><u>Preserving Trust in our Infospace</u></strong>
</p>
<p>45. So let me turn now to my final theme. We share the same concern as
members that AI-enabled tools, like deepfakes, may be abused to cause harm.</p>
<p>a. This is why we passed the Elections (Integrity of Online Advertising)
(Amendment) Act to protect Singaporeans from the threat of AI-generated
misinformation during elections.</p>
<p>b. We are also developing a new Code of Practice to require social media
companies to prevent and counter abuse of fake content.</p>
<p>46. These measures, while important, are not enough. Against the tide
of false information online, we must have trusted sources to turn to.</p>
<p>a. Thankfully, our Public Service Media (PSM) entities remain many Singaporeans’
first port of call for credible news.</p>
<p>b. The Straits Times and CNA are amongst our most frequented online news
platforms, with more than 40% of Singaporeans reading them weekly.</p>
<p>c. More importantly, public trust in our mainstream media remains high,
with CNA and The Straits Times being the most trusted by Singaporeans at
74% and 73% respectively. Meanwhile, public trust in mainstream news has
fallen in other countries, hovering at 60% or below.&nbsp;</p>
<p>47. Many Singaporeans, including Ms Hany Soh and Mr Sharael Taha, appreciate
the efforts of Mediacorp and SPH Media to adapt to changing audience preferences.
Against a climate of stiff competition, news fatigue and opaque algorithms
on social media platforms, both companies are committed to increase audience
reach.</p>
<p>48. However, falling revenues have forced their newsrooms to rationalise.</p>
<p>a. SPH Media ceased publication of its Chinese entertainment magazine,
U-Weekly.</p>
<p>b. Last October, Mediacorp merged TODAY Online with CNA's Digital newsroom.</p>
<p>49. Mr Pritam Singh expressed concerns about SPH Media’s performance.</p>
<p>a. Like news outlets worldwide, SPH Media’s print subscriptions have declined
as readers shift to consuming news online.</p>
<p>b. However, less than 20% of consumers in advanced countries, including
Singapore, now pay for digital news subscriptions. Essentially, they can
get it for free and they will continue to enjoy such services for free.</p>
<p>c. Without revealing commercially sensitive information, I can share that
SPH Media's digital subscriptions have held steady, and it is now 35% higher
than print subscriptions. It was only 20% higher two years ago. So, you
see the shift.</p>
<p>d. SPH Media will have to continue its pivot to digital news and the Government
must support this effort so that our PSM entities can meet audiences where
they are.</p>
<p>50. Despite not meeting all their KPIs last year, SPH Media did not ask
to lower their targets.</p>
<p>a. They are determined to maintain their reach and relevance with Singaporeans.</p>
<p>b. In 2024, they maintained their strong overall reach at 70% of Singapore’s
resident population, although youth and vernacular reach dipped.</p>
<p>51. In line with the funding agreement, MDDI will pro-rate and award the
Performance-Linked Incentives accordingly.</p>
<p>52. I would like to address, slightly, to some extent, the comment that
was made by Mr Pritam Singh when he compared CNA and The Straits Times.
I would suggest respectfully to Members that comparisons must avoid oversimplification.</p>
<p>a. Because we have to remember that CNA is mainly our national broadcaster
as well as digital news channel, whereas most of the assets of the SPH
Media Trust are still print - even though they have digital versions -
and they are meant to be national papers of record. So, they are different
and complementary.</p>
<p>b. And it is again, my humble suggestion for Members to look at the performance
of PSM holistically. Because in truth, we need all of them, to reach as
many Singaporeans as we can. So that is something to keep in mind. And
as mentioned, both CNA and The Straits Times remain the top frequented
news channels.</p>
<p>c. And Members who expressed concerns about the sustainability of PSM
would agree with me that the KPIs, such as reach, are important, but they
are not the only ways for us to assess the performance and the effectiveness
of PSM entities. Equally, we must look at the trust levels that they are
able to harness from the population, and we must also look at satisfaction
levels.</p>
<p>d. And so those would be the additional KPIs that we are looking to introduce.</p>
<p>53. Meanwhile, let me also point to the threat to broadcast television,
with consumers shifting to platforms like YouTube or Netflix.</p>
<p>a. Even when PSM entities go onto these platforms, the experiences abroad
suggest that placements and algorithms in the digital environment disadvantage
them.</p>
<p>b. Countries like the UK and Australia have therefore made new rules.
They now require Connected TVs to be pre-loaded with public service media
apps like BBC iPlayer, or ABC iview, and to display these apps prominently
on their user interfaces.</p>
<p>54. Given the important role of our PSM entities to inform, educate and
connect Singaporeans, we must be very concerned about their visibility
being obscured by the decisions of third-party platforms.</p>
<p>55. Our PSM content must remain visible and easily accessible to our audiences.</p>
<p>a. Therefore, MDDI is studying the regulatory moves in other countries
to safeguard the “prominence” and “discoverability” of PSM.</p>
<p>b. We will consult industry stakeholders, including device manufacturers,
before deciding the next steps.</p>
<p><strong><u>Conclusion</u></strong>
</p>
<p>56. Sir, please allow me to conclude in Mandarin.</p>
<p>57. 主席先生, 新加坡是高度开放、高度数码化的国家。国人能从各种平台获取信息 — 无论是小红书、Facebook，Netflix、iQiyi，许多国人都不陌生。</p>
<p>a. 但接收的信息越多，我们的判断力是否更强，还是被削弱？社会是否更团结，还是日益分化？这些都值得我们深思。</p>
<p>b. 事实上，在地缘政治竞争加剧的时代，自身的叙述能力受限，对于维护国家立场和国人认同感都是坏事。</p>
<p>c. 在这方面，我国的公共服务媒体 - 如新传媒和联合早报 - 扮演了重要的角色。只有他们会从新加坡的视角报道新闻、分析国际事件对我们的影响。</p>
<p>d. 因此，政府正在探讨，在新的媒体环境中，如何让国人更轻易接触到公共服务媒体的内容。</p>
<p>58. 当然，社会凝聚力受到威胁，并非唯一担忧。有人问我：网络世界充满危险，新加坡是否能放慢或暂停数码化的脚步？</p>
<p>e. 的确，现实生活的新加坡很安全。网络世界则无明显的国界、危机四伏。</p>
<p>f. 然而，我国地小、缺资源。在环球竞争激烈的时代，数码化是我们突破局限，蓬勃发展的关键。</p>
<p>59. 数码之行，不进则退。</p>
<p>g. 政府必须采取的是明智的策略 — 帮助国人、企业提升数码技能，并加强网络安全意识。</p>
<p>h. 这样，新加坡才能牢牢把握数码时代的新机遇，我们的工友才能向前迈进，进一步的争取良好的就业机会！</p>
