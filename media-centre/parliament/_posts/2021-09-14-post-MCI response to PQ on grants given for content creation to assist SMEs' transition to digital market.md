### Parliament Sitting on 14 September 2021

QUESTION FOR WRITTEN ANSWER
---------------------------

  
**34\. Mr Christopher de Souza:** To ask the Minister for Communications and Information whether grants can be given specifically for content creation so as to assist SMEs in not only transitioning to a digital market but continuing to remain competitive and attractive to potential customers.  
  
**Answer:**

1. The Government provides targeted support to help small and medium enterprises (SMEs) thrive in an increasingly digitalised economy. With more SMEs going online as a new channel for growth, programmes like SMEs Go Digital not only help SMEs make the leap, but also enhance their productivity and refresh their product offerings, all of which are essential for SMEs to remain competitive and to grow their customer base. Recognising that our SMEs need content creation as part of digital marketing to help them grow, we are looking to support this under the Productivity Solutions Grant (PSG).  
  
2. In the meantime, under the SMEs Go Digital programme, SMEs can tap on pre-approved digital solutions to develop their e-commerce websites with up to 80% of the costs defrayed by the PSG. Newly-incorporated SMEs can also adopt basic digital marketing or e-commerce tools at no cost for at least 6 months using the foundational Start Digital Packs. In addition, SMEs can adopt Grow Digital solutions, which are Business-to-Business and Business-to-Consumer e-commerce platforms that enable them to access regional or global markets; also with grant support.   
  
3. All these digital solutions have been brought together to address SMEs’ needs across the economy, with sector-specific solutions in line with the respective Industry Digital Plans. We will continue to review our schemes to ensure that the support available remains relevant and appropriate for SMEs’ needs in this dynamic environment.
