### Parliament Sitting on 7 October 2019

QUESTION FOR WRITTEN ANSWER
---------------------------

**45\. Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye:** To ask the Minister for Communications and Information (a) in the past three years, what is the number of complaint cases reported to the Do Not Call (DNC) registry; (b) how many of these complaint cases are repeated cases involving the same complainant's phone number; and (c) what actions have been taken against the perpetrators.    
  
**Answer:**

1. Mr. Speaker, since 2017, the Personal Data Protection Commission (“PDPC”) has received 46,600 complaints on unsolicited calls and text messages.  Around 90% of these complaints relate to serious crimes such as unlicensed moneylending and illegal gambling, and are referred to the Singapore Police Force.  Of the remainder, about 400 complaints are repeat cases involving the same complainants.  

2. The PDPC has taken action against more than 1,000 organisations since 2017.  These actions range from issuing advisory notices and warnings to prosecution.  In determining the appropriate enforcement action, the PDPC takes into account factors such as the harm caused, the number of complaints against the organisation and recidivism.  The PDPC keeps a close watch on organisations’ compliance with the Do Not Call obligations, and will not hesitate to take appropriate enforcement action against errant organisations.
