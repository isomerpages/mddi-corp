<h3>Parliament Sitting on 15 October 2024</h3>
<h3>QUESTION FOR WRITTEN ANSWER</h3>
<p><strong>14. Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis </strong>asked the Minister for Digital
Development and Information (a) what percentage of movies and TV programmes
on free-to-air television are shown in Chinese dialects; (b) of these,
what is the percentage as further broken down by the type of Chinese dialect;
and (c) how has the percentage changed over the last five years.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
</p>
<p>Dialect content is allowed to a limited extent on free-to-air (FTA) television
to support the prevailing language policy of Mandarin as one of the four
official languages. This includes a dedicated two-hour belt of full dialect
programmes every Friday late morning on Mediacorp’s Channel 8, which comprises
over 90 hours, or 1 per cent of Channel 8’s total transmission hours per
year. This has remained constant over the years. The breakdown of dialects
used is not tracked as in most instances, a mix of dialects may be used
during a programme.</p>
