<h3>Parliament Sitting on 12 November 2024</h3>
<h3>QUESTION FOR WRITTEN ANSWER</h3>
<p><strong>24. Ms Usha Chandradas </strong>asked the Minister for Digital
Development and Information whether the Infocomm Media Development Authority
will consider offering expedited processing channels for the review and
issuance of arts entertainment licences where applicants require urgent
confirmation.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
</p>
<p>Applicants for arts entertainment licences (AELs) are required to submit
their applications to the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) at
least 40 working days before the commencement of the arts entertainment.
This timeline recognises the unique nature of each application and the
need for case-by-case review. Applications are usually processed within
20 working days upon receipt of complete information.</p>
<p>In 2023, 95 per cent of AELs were issued within the service standard of
20 working days upon the receipt of complete information. A longer processing
time may be needed if an application contains incomplete or inaccurate
information, or if the content is contentious and requires consultation
with the Arts Consultative Panel or other relevant stakeholders. Applicants
are therefore encouraged to submit their materials early for IMDAâ€™s assessment.</p>
