### Parliament Sitting on 5 October 2020

QUESTION FOR WRITTEN ANSWER
---------------------------

**24. Ms Tin Pei Ling:** To ask the Minister for Communications and Information whether he can provide an update on the digital ambassador outreach effort since its implementation.  
  
**Answer:**  
  
1. Since the SG Digital Office (SDO) was established in June this year, it has mobilised 1,000 Digital Ambassadors (DAs) to drive e-payment adoption among stallholders under the ‘Hawkers Go Digital’ programme, and equip seniors with digital skills under ‘Seniors Go Digital’. Through these efforts, more than 7,200 stallholders have signed-up for the SGQR Unified e-Payment solution. Our DAs have also engaged more than 21,500 seniors at the 34 SG Digital Community Hubs at community centres that SDO has set up island-wide. 21 more community hubs will be set up at our libraries in the coming months.  
  
2. There have been good outcomes from SDO’s efforts. In a survey of seniors who completed SDO’s training programmes in July, 95% were satisfied with the training they received, and 80% continued to apply at least one digital skill that they had learnt. We have also seen a 65% increase in SGQR transactions since the launch of Hawkers Go Digital.  
  
3. SDO is also working with partners to amplify its efforts. To support digital skilling of seniors, SDO has partnered with community organisations such as Youth Corps Singapore to support the rollout of digital training at Senior Activity Centres. For businesses and hawkers, SDO has been working closely with grassroot volunteers to reach out to stallholders, and is supporting IMDA and ESG’s joint efforts to uplift digitalisation capabilities in the heartlands.  
  
4. SDO will sustain its efforts to support all Singaporeans as Singapore continues its digitalisation journey. We encourage our seniors to visit SDO’s community hubs and engage with our DAs and volunteers, who can help them to go digital.
