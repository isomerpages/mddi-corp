<h3>Parliament Sitting on 2 July 2024</h3>
<h3>QUESTION FOR ORAL ANSWER</h3>
<p><strong>*59. Ms He Ting Ru</strong> asked the Minister for Communications
and Information (a) what specific breakthroughs or advancements in data
centre efficiency, liquid cooling, and tropical operations have been achieved
by Singapore companies and research institutes during the 2019-2022 moratorium
period; (b) how these innovations compare to the state-of-the-art globally;
and (c) whether any of these innovations have been commercially implemented
at scale locally or internationally.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
</p>
<p>Data centres (DCs) are foundational to Singapore’s digital economy. However,
they are intensive users of electricity and water. The three-year pause
in the growth of the DC industry was imposed to study how this growth could
be managed sustainably, in line with our international climate commitments.</p>
<p>During this pause, the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA), and
the Singapore Economic Development Board , consulted the industry and end-users
extensively on ways to grow our DC sector sustainably through best-in-class
and energy-efficient DCs. One key approach was the pilot DC-Call for Application
(or DC-CFA) in 2022 to invite proposals for sustainable DCs. The four DC
operators that were awarded capacity in the call have committed to building
new DCs with innovations such as liquid cooling and the use of energy-efficient
IT equipment.</p>
<p>In addition to the DC-CFA, we are developing new standards to shift existing
and new DCs towards greener operations. These include the world’s first
Tropical DC standard, which enables DCs in Singapore and other similar
climates to operate safely at higher temperatures, and thus reduce the
energy needed for cooling. This new standard complements global industry
best practices, which are already adopted by many DCs locally.</p>
<p>To ensure that Singapore remains at the forefront of DC sustainability,
IMDA recently released the Green DC Roadmap, which outlines the Government’s
plans to work with the industry to pioneer solutions for greater energy
efficiency at the hardware and software levels, as well as to accelerate
the use of green energy.</p>
