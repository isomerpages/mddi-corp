<h3>Parliament Sitting on 5 February 2025</h3>
<h3>QUESTION FOR WRITTEN ANSWER</h3>
<p><strong>26. Ms See Jinli Jean</strong> asked the Minister for Digital Development
and Information (a) what are the measures in place to ensure that the Productivity
Solution Grant vendors are motivated to update the pricing of their pre-approved
automation and digital solutions when there is continual lowering of the
cost of such technological products in the commercial marketplace; and
(b) how can businesses provide feedback to the Government on the value-for-money
quality of pre-approved technology products to ensure that such grant can
be best optimised.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
</p>
<p>The Productivity Solutions Grant (PSG) supports businesses’ adoption of
pre-approved solutions under the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA)’s
SMEs Go Digital programme, which aims to help businesses improve productivity
and enhance their business processes.</p>
<p>The PSG supports a diverse range of solutions and vendors, which businesses
can choose from. This variety promotes price and quality competitiveness
among vendors. Businesses are encouraged to choose solutions that best
suits their needs and are value for money.</p>
