<h3>Parliament Sitting on 10 September 2024</h3>
<h3>QUESTION FOR ORAL ANSWER</h3>
<p><strong>*34. Ms See Jinli Jean </strong>asked the Minister for Digital
Development and Information whether the Ministry will consider requiring
(i) firms that have been awarded creative projects by Ministries and Government
agencies to endeavour towards engaging Singapore-registered sub-contractors
and local talents, crew, and facilities for their projects and (ii) these
firms to dedicate a reasonable portion of their budget in engaging local
talents and crew, so as to boost the capabilities of the Singapore creative
workforce and growth of a creative economy.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
</p>
<p>Ministries and Government agencies procure creative services in various
ways, and many do so via the Whole-of-Government Period Contracts and Framework
Agreements (PCFAs). Vendors under the Creative Services and Video &amp;
Animation Services PCFA are required to adopt Tripartite Standards, which
covers fair recruitment practices and the procurement of services from
media freelancers. Creative agencies must however be allowed to hire talents
that best meet the needs of their clients in the most cost-effective way.</p>
<p>The Government is committed to supporting our local artistes and the development
of the creative industry. Government agencies have programmes and grants
to uplift the capabilities of local talent and companies in the industry
such as the National Arts Council’s Presentation and Participation Grant
and the Infocomm Media Development Authority’s Media Talent Progression
Programme.</p>
