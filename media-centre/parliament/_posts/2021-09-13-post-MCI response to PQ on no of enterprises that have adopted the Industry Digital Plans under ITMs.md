### Parliament Sitting on 13 September 2021

QUESTION FOR WRITTEN ANSWER
---------------------------

  
**56\. Mr Abdul Samad:** To ask the Minister for Communications and Information (a) to date, how many enterprises have adopted the Industry Digital Plans under the 23 Industry Transformation Maps; and (b) how many local workers from these enterprises have seen their jobs and skills been upgraded through digitalisation and mechanisation.  
  
**Answer:**  

1. Industry Digital Plans (IDPs) are developed in line with Singapore’s Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs), to provide enterprises with sector-specific guidance on digital solutions to support their growth. IDPs also recommend digital skills training that workers should undertake to be ready for digital transformation in their sector. We have launched 18 IDPs since 2017, tailored to the needs of 16 ITM sectors.1 As of 31 May 2021, more than 75,000 small and medium enterprises (SMEs) have benefitted from the adoption of digital solutions in line with the IDPs, under the SMEs Go Digital programme which was also launched in 2017.   
  
2. For workers specifically, the IDPs provide a Digital Roadmap on Training that identifies relevant courses for digital skills upgrading, ranging from broad-based training courses to more advanced digital courses. Since 2016, more than 117,000 individuals have been trained under the TechSkills Accelerator (TeSA) initiative through digital courses such as AI, cloud computing, cybersecurity, data analytics, digital media and tech-enabled services.  
  
3. We will develop IDPs or equivalents for all 23 ITM sectors in due course. These initiatives reflect our commitment to ensuring that enterprises and workers in all sectors of our economy are well-prepared to seize the opportunities that arise from digital transformation.

1  Several ITM sectors have multiple IDPs to cater to the needs of key sub-sectors. For instance, under the Sea Transport ITM sector, there are separate IDPs for the sub-sectors of Bunkering, Harbour Craft, and Ship Agency.
