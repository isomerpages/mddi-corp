<h3>Parliament Sitting on 7 January 2025</h3>
<h3>QUESTION FOR WRITTEN ANSWER</h3>
<p><strong>38. Ms Usha Chandradas </strong>asked the Minister for Digital
Development and Information (a) whether the National Library Board has
implemented any public lending&nbsp;rights schemes in respect of literary
works written or published by local authors or&nbsp; publishers that may
address potential related issues such as the loss of sales of these&nbsp;works
when they are borrowed from libraries instead of being purchased; and (b)
if not,&nbsp;why not.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
</p>
<p>A Public Lending Right (PLR) scheme is premised on the idea&nbsp;that
authors or other rightsholders should receive some form of compensation
for the loan&nbsp;of their books by public or other libraries. This has
been implemented in some countries,&nbsp;such as the United Kingdom, Denmark
and Norway.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, there is no international consensus on the need for, or benefits
of PLR. The&nbsp;International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions’
(IFLA’s) position is&nbsp;that there is little evidence that library lending
causes such loss to authors that demand&nbsp;compensation through PLR.
As such, IFLA does not support the principles of PLR,&nbsp;which can threaten
free access to public library services. Instead, IFLA advocates for&nbsp;more
appropriate and efficient ways to support authors. This is the position
shared by the&nbsp;vast majority of libraries around the world. Given the
lack of international consensus on&nbsp;the benefits of PLR schemes, the
Government has not put in place legislation that requires libraries in
Singapore, including the National Library Board (NLB), to implement such
a scheme.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The lending by NLB promotes equitable access to knowledge and enjoyment
through&nbsp;reading and is a key platform for the discovery of local authors
and publishers. NLB&nbsp; supports local authors and publishers through
the purchase of their books, and raising awareness of Singapore Literature,
authors and publishers through a broad range of&nbsp;initiatives. These
include NLB’s signature events like Read! Fest and the National Reading
Movement, which aim to nurture a vibrant reading culture here. NLB also
works&nbsp;with many partners across the literary ecosystem to organise
talks by authors, support&nbsp;book launches, as well as arrange discussions
and hands-on workshops with Singapore&nbsp;writers. NLB even facilitates
the sale of books by local authors at selected events. NLB&nbsp;will continue
with such efforts to create a vibrant reading eco-system in Singapore.
The promotion of literacy and a love for books creates a society that is
more likely to support local authors.</p>
