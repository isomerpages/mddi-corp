<h3>Parliament Sitting on 29 February 2024</h3>
<h3>QUESTION FOR WRITTEN ANSWER</h3>
<p><strong>14. Mr Yip Hon Weng: </strong>To ask the Minister for Communications
and Information (a) what are the potential social and psychological impacts
of metaverse and virtual reality technologies on human interaction and
connection in the Singaporean context; and (b) how are relevant stakeholders
such as parents, educators and mental health professionals equipped to
guide and support children and young adults to navigate the social dimensions
of these virtual environments.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>MCI is not aware of definitive research findings regarding the social
and psychological impacts of metaverse and virtual reality technologies.
Our consistent approach has been to work with partners to develop and update
public education initiatives to equip Singaporeans to use technology in
a safe, healthy and balanced manner. For example,&nbsp;
<br>
</p>
<p>a. The National Library Board’s (NLB) Read to be SURE initiative provides&nbsp;resources
on the benefits and risks of technology, including the metaverse.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>b. Digital for Life (DfL) Festival in 2023 provided opportunities for
parents and children to learn about emerging technologies and also how
to protect themselves against potential online harms.&nbsp;
<br>
</p>
<p>c. Recently, the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) also launched
bite-sized resources on the DfL portal to support parents in guiding their
children’s online interactions.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where appropriate regulatory actions can be taken, we have implemented
them in a timely manner. For example, we have introduced a Code of Practice
for Social Media Services. Later this year, we will also introduce a Code
of Practice for App Distribution Services to ensure age-appropriate access.</p>
</li>
</ol>
