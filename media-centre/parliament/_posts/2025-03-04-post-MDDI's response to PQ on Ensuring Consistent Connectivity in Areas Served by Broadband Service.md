<h3>Parliament Sitting on 4 March 2025</h3>
<h3>QUESTION FOR WRITTEN ANSWER</h3>
<p><strong>7. Ms Mariam Jaafar</strong> asked the Minister for Digital Development
and Information what steps are taken to ensure that broadband service providers
do not leave pockets of poor broadband connectivity in fully connected
areas.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
</p>
<p>Our Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) that provide mobile broadband services
have achieved over 99% nationwide outdoor mobile coverage for their 4G
networks, and over 95% nationwide outdoor mobile coverage for their 5G
networks. MNOs are also required to meet the Quality of Service standard
for 4G coverage of over 85% per building, as well as over 99% coverage
for nationwide outdoor areas, and all roads / Mass Rapid Transit tunnels.</p>
<p>The Infocomm Media Development Authority regularly monitors the performance
of these services and will require the service providers to improve their
performance to meet the requirements if there are gaps.</p>
