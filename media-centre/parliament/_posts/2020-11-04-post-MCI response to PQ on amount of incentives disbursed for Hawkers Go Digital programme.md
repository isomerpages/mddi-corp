### Parliament Sitting on 4 November 2020 

QUESTION FOR WRITTEN ANSWER
---------------------------

**27. Mr Ang Wei Neng:** To ask the Minister for Communications and Information under the Hawkers Go Digital programme, what is the total amount of incentives disbursed to date to the hawkers who have adopted digital payment.   
  
**Answer:**  
  
1. The Hawkers Go Digital programme was launched on 8 June to encourage stallholders to adopt the unified e-payment solution. This initiative aims to reach out to 18,000 stallholders by June 2021. To encourage adoption, an e-payment bonus of up to $1,500 will be given to stallholders who have demonstrated sustained use of the e-payment solution. A bonus of $300 will be paid for each month that they have completed at least 20 transactions on the unified e-payment solution, for up to 5 months.  Transactions must be completed by 31 May 2021.   
  
2. As of 23 Oct 2020, 8,100 stallholders are now offering the unified SGQR e-payment solution.  A total of $4.8 million has since been disbursed to 5,400 stallholders under the Hawkers Go Digital programme.
