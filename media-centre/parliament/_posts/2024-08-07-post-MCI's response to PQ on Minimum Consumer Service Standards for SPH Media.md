<h3>Parliament Sitting on 7 August 2024</h3>
<h3>QUESTION FOR ORAL ANSWER</h3>
<p><strong>*51. Dr Tan Wu Meng</strong> asked the Minister for Digital Development
and Information whether the Government funding to SPH Media has conditions
specifying minimum consumer service standards, including the provision
of hardcopy newspaper delivery to the doorstep and not just the mailbox
of customers who have subscribed to daily newspapers' print editions.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
</p>
<p>Government funding to SPH Media Trust (SMT) is intended to support its
talent, technology, and vernacular capabilities. As part of the funding
requirements, SMT must also ensure the circulation and delivery of its
Flagship Titlesâ€™ print copies, on all days except Print Holidays. This
applies to the Straits Times, Lianhe Zaobao, Berita Harian, Tamil Murasu,
and the Business Times. SMT should also inform the Government, as well
as the public, and deploy contingency arrangements if there are unexpected
delays in circulation affecting a significant proportion of home deliveries.
There are penalties if SMT reports more than an acceptable number of such
unplanned incidents.</p>
<p>Outside of these requirements, SMT has autonomy over its business operations,
including how newspapers are delivered to subscribers. It is important
that SMT has flexibility to decide on the optimal delivery approach as
it relies on some 390 vendors which face different challenges including
manpower shortages.</p>
