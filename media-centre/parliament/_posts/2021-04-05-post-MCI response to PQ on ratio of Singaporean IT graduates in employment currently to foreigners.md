### Parliament Sitting on 5 April 2021

QUESTION FOR WRITTEN ANSWER
---------------------------

**19**. **Mr Abdul Samad**: To ask the Minister for Communications and Information (a) what is the ratio of Singaporean IT graduates in employment currently to foreigners; and (b) how many Singaporean IT students are expected to graduate in one to three years’ time.

**Answer:**

1. Today, there are about 200,000 Infocomm Technology professionals in our economy, with the proportion of local tech talent holding steady at 70% amidst rapid growth and intense global competition.   
  
2. Over the next three years, our Pre-Employment Training (PET) pipeline from Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) will generate around 22,000 local tech talent supplemented by at least 6,250 from place-and-train Continuing Education and Training (CET) programmes. To keep pace with the growing demand for tech talent, we have made deliberate efforts to widen our pipeline by expanding our PET intake in IHLs and investing in CET programmes. 

3. The Government is committed to working closely with our IHLs and industry, ensuring that Singaporeans are able to secure quality jobs and stay competitive in this dynamic landscape.
