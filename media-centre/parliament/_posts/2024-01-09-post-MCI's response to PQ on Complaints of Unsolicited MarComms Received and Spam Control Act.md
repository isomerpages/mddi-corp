<h3>Parliament Sitting on 9 January 2024</h3><h3>QUESTION FOR WRITTEN ANSWER</h3><p><strong>50. Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye: </strong>To ask the Minister for Communications and Information (a) in each of the past five years, how many complaints relating to unsolicited marketing communications have been received; (b) of these, how many have been successfully taken to task under the Spam Control Act; and (c) whether there is a need to review the Act to ensure its effectiveness.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><ol data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>Our regulatory regime to combat unsolicited communications consists of the Do Not Call (“DNC”) Provisions within the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”) and Spam Control Act 2007 (“SCA”). They cover different areas.</p><p></p></li><li><p>The PDPA’s DNC Provisions cover the sending of unsolicited marketing messages communicated via voice, text, and fax messages to Singapore telephone numbers. There has been a significant reduction in the number of DNC Complaints received by the Personal Data Protection Commission (“PDPC”) over the past five years, as reflected in <u>Table 1</u>.</p></li></ol><p><u>Table 1: Number of DNC Complaints Received</u></p><table><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Calendar Year</strong></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>DNC Complaints Received</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>2019</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>23,548</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>2020</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>14,549</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>2021</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>11,651</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>2022</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>3,900</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>2023</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>2,144</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><ol start="3" data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>The SCA complements the DNC Provisions by setting out requirements in relation to the sending of unsolicited marketing emails. The SCA adopts a civil-based regime for the enforcement of its requirements, where aggrieved parties can take direct legal action<a href="#_ftn1" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">[1]</a> against senders. Given the civil-based regime, there is no specific enforcement authority. Consequently, PDPC does not track individual cases.</p></li></ol><p></p><hr><p><a href="#_ftnref1" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">[1]</a> The court could grant injunction, damages, and statutory damages.</p>
