<h3>Parliament Sitting on 5 February 2024</h3>
<p>1. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</p>
<p>2. I thank Mr. Giam, for raising some very important issues to do with
AI. I thank him for reading our National Artificial Intelligence Strategy
in some detail. I would encourage him to read the many other documents
that we have written, which describe how we are already doing many of the
things he has listed in his speech. I thank him in advance for supporting
the investments that we plan to make to deliver the various outcomes that
he has detailed.</p>
<p>3. He suggested a number of important outcomes, and we have made some
of the same points in the past. I thank him for agreeing with us on a number
of key ideas such as that the use of technology and AI should benefit Singapore
and Singaporeans. We agree how we approach AI development should result
in better jobs for Singaporeans. We agree that our approach should lead
to skills development and knowledge transfer for Singaporeans and Singapore.</p>
<p>4. Ambitious, innovative projects should be attempted to create opportunities.
AI can be transformative for healthcare, and our small size as a nation
should not deter us from seeking excellence and potentially global leadership
in AI. We agree with all this. We have said all this before. And I am glad
that he thinks we should do this.</p>
<p>5. But how we do so and how we proceed matters. How should we achieve
these outcomes? Here, perhaps our views differ. I would point out that
in talking through the mechanisms and the suggestions that Mr. Giam has
made, his speech does have some internal contradictions. Statements that
he makes to support one strategy, perhaps in contradiction to another.</p>
<p>6. Here are three examples.</p>
<p>7. He talks about the constraints of our local private sector and our
small domestic market, but he wants to suggest exactly doing that in restricting
the development of an AI system within Singapore.</p>
<p>8. He talks about how there is no global cross border framework around
data sharing, but he wants to worsen that by suggesting data localization
and sovereignty strategies.</p>
<p>9. At one part of his speech, he talks about how there is a level playing
field for AI with a highly collaborative open-source community. And then
later on, he worries about how this has market dominance and network effects
that will make it hard for us to penetrate the market.</p>
<p>10. So, there are internal contradictions. He has differing views depending
on the differing recommendations. And I think the government also has a
different view of how we should achieve the outcomes. But I would reiterate,
we agree that the outcomes are the same.</p>
<p>11. So, on the outcomes, traditional industrial policy approaches where
governments pick winners and centrally plan the way to success are not
going to be effective for frontier digital technologies like AI. Our approach
should target excellence in key domains and create an environment with
solid foundations that maximise our chances of success.</p>
<p>12. We shouldn't seek global leadership just for the sake of it. We advance
Singapore's interest by growing our AI ecosystem, partnering internationally,
creating good jobs, and benefiting our companies and our citizens. We will
be sharing more details on the implementation of the recently launched
National Artificial Intelligence Strategy 2.0 at the Committee of Supply
debates, but let me just recap on a few ideas.</p>
<p>13. The strategy focuses on harnessing AI for the public good for Singapore
and the world. It outlines key enablers and actions that Singapore will
take in the coming years to achieve the twin goals of excellence - developing
peaks of excellence in AI - including to address the needs and challenges
of our time, such as climate change and population health. And secondly,
empowerment, where we raise up individuals, businesses, and communities
to use AI with confidence, discernment, and trust.</p>
<p>14. Our approach is for AI to have widespread and positive impact on our
economy and on our society. That is why we will develop peaks of excellence
across domains and across our economy selected on the probability to deliver
an outsized impact to Singapore and the lives of Singaporeans. These peaks
include leading economic sectors such as manufacturing and financial services,
those relevant to Singapore's smart nation priorities, healthcare and education.</p>
<p>15. For healthcare, we have dedicated $35 million dollars through the
AI in Health Grand Challenge since 2019, to support innovative projects
that use AI to predict risks, tailor treatments and enhance health coaching.
We already use data sets across various healthcare registries and databases
to train AI models, and these are already being piloted for use in clinics
across Singapore.</p>
<p>16. Recently, SingHealth together with MOH, A*STAR and the National Supercomputing
Centre organised the AI Health Summit 2023. It featured local and international
experts discussing the application of advanced AI in healthcare, and it
demonstrated many of the projects that are already in development here
in Singapore.</p>
<p>17. Across our society we will address peaks of excellence for AI. We
will anchor integrated and transformative AI innovation and value creation
activities here, working with companies to base their AI Centres of Excellence,
to build new products, and develop intellectual property across the AI
stack here in Singapore. We have a new model of sectoral Centres of Excellence
- partnering industry champions to identify sectoral use cases, developing
a broader base of researchers and companies to intensify sophisticated
AI development and deployment here.</p>
<p>18. We are also working to speed up value discovery, experimentation and
innovation, including the AI Trailblazers initiative - working with Google
Cloud to help enterprises bring novel generative AI use cases to life in
a hundred days.</p>
<p>19. Creating this environment for many projects, many peaks of excellence
have two key benefits. One is that it makes it more likely that we benefit
all either through economic opportunity, by being part of the industry,
or as a beneficiary of the new service. The second key benefit is that
not all projects are successful. With moonshots, Mr. Giam will know that
outcomes are inherently uncertain, and the original moonshot certainly
did not have a friction-free path to success. Outcomes are inherently uncertain,
they are not always clear. And even with the best efforts, we may not get
the desired or expected results.</p>
<p>20. So, as we embark on ambitious and innovative projects, I hope we can
count on Mr. Giam’s support to still stand in support of us having made
the attempt in the spirit of a moonshot, even when it doesn't quite work
out in the way we expect. So, trying several different ideas, creating
the opportunity for innovation and inventiveness, rather than trying to
pick symbolic projects, is far more likely to generate a success.</p>
<p>21. Anchoring AI activities is only one part of the picture. A strong
AI ecosystem also requires skilled AI practitioners. We want to grow a
pool of such high-value and skilled jobs here in Singapore.</p>
<p>22. As discussed extensively in this house, including by Dr. Tan Wu Meng
on behalf of his Clementi residents, and I think representing the concerns
of residents across Singapore; in successive budget speeches; the 2023
presidential address debate; parliamentary questions; our recent parliamentary
motion: None of these will become a reality, if we do not train, upskill,
and reskill our labour force. That point has been made, and the government's
key focus is on training our people. This will allow Singaporeans to capture
new opportunities and shape their future.</p>
<p>23. For example, the Tech Skills Accelerator and AI apprenticeship programmes
have trained many Singaporeans to take on AI related roles, and we will
elaborate on additional plans at the Committee of Supply. We have also
started work on equipping our students with skills relevant to artificial
intelligence, and we develop students’ foundational knowledge of AI and
promotes its safe and responsible use in schools.</p>
<p>24. That said, it is important to recognise that global AI talent plays
a complementary role. They serve as a bridge to expertise, perspectives,
innovative approaches elsewhere, that are crucial for the information exchange
and skills transfer to strengthen our ecosystem.</p>
<p>25. Today, we are already experiencing strong demand for AI talent here
in Singapore. Given the fierce competition for this talent globally, it
would be quite unwise to limit the pool of skilled practitioners we can
draw from and potentially hindering our ecosystem growth.</p>
<p>26. There are some other essential enablers that we need here. We need
to have sufficient compute power, so that industry, academia and the government
can innovate, build and deploy high value solutions.</p>
<p>27. Our strategy on data is important in advancing our AI aspirations.
Our approach on data is premised on supporting innovation, serving the
public good and making sure that relevant safeguards are in place. We focus
on improving the quality of datasets, building up our capability, and ensuring
that data used for AI development is aligned with trusted data sharing
frameworks.</p>
<p>28. But domestic data and local AI models are not enough for Singapore
to achieve our ambitions. We must maintain our ability to access and use
global data and models to deliver good outcomes for Singapore and Singaporeans.</p>
<p>29. It is important to resist the allure of data localisation narratives
- it sounds very seductive. But instead, we need to remain connected, allow
for and advocate for cross border data flows, as long as adequate protection
is ensured. Recent legislations and large countries avoid this idea of
explicit localisation provisions. Even with their large markets and large
datasets, they recognise the benefits of being connected to the world.
And we benefit from openness and connectivity to the world for our partners
to share with us in good faith. They are less likely to do so if we close
ourselves off. Singapore has thrived as part of a connected world.</p>
<p>30. Mr. Giam spoke about industrial policy. It is the nature of the tech
and digital space that government cannot pick winners and certainly cannot
centrally plan their way to success. There is also the issue of the cost
associated with the approach he suggests. He proposes, I believe, that
we rely on our own data only, and develop an AI model at scale ourselves.
I think that is what he is suggesting. And I would point out that companies
have to invest tens of billions of US dollars, for one generative AI model.
If we took the approach that he suggests, we may only be able to afford
to participate in one or two projects and is that going to be the best
approach for Singapore?</p>
<p>31. AI is a fast moving, inherently borderless technology. For Singapore
to succeed, we must remain open – open to innovation, talent, data, and
ideas from around the world. We will also need to work with partners from
around the world to address the wide-ranging impact that AI can potentially
have.</p>
<p>32. Taking a protectionist stance will do us more harm than good, and
it will undermine our hard-won credibility as a serious, constructive,
inclusive society and nation.</p>
<p>33. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</p>
