<h3>Parliament Sitting on 3 April 2024</h3>
<h3>QUESTION FOR WRITTEN ANSWER</h3>
<p><strong>27. Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis:</strong> To ask the Minister for Communications
and Information given the absence of a ‘right to erasure’ clause, whether
the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 provides for (i) individuals who
have not given consent for the collection, use, or disclosure of their
personal data and requiring an organisation to delete their personal data
upon request and (ii) the recourse for such individuals if the organisation
does not do so.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
</p>
<p>1. The Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) requires an organisation to
cease retention of personal data or dispose of it in a proper manner when
it is no longer needed for the purposes it was collected for, or other
legitimate business or legal purpose.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. This requirement applies regardless of whether consent had or had not
been given for the organisation’s collection, use or disclosure of personal
data. Retention limits under the PDPA sufficiently safeguard the further
use of an individual’s personal data. If the organisation does not adhere
to these requirements, the Personal Data Protection Commission (PDPC) has
the power to direct the organisation to destroy, or stop collecting, using,
or disclosing, the personal data concerned.</p>
