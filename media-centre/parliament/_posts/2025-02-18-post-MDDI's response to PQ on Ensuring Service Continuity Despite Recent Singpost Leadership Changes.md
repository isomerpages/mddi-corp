<h3>Parliament Sitting on 18 February 2025</h3>
<h3>QUESTION FOR ORAL ANSWER</h3>
<p><strong>*41. Mr Neil Parekh Nimil Rajnikant</strong> asked the Minister
for Digital Development and Information what steps are being taken to ensure
that services to the Singaporean public are not affected by the recent
spate of leadership changes at SingPost.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
</p>
<p>The Ministry of Digital Development and Information had addressed related
queries at the 7 January 2025 Parliament sitting. Notwithstanding the changes
in leadership, SingPost is expected to comply with its Quality of Service
standards and Universal Service Obligations as a Public Postal Licensee.
They have done so thus far. Nonetheless, the Infocomm Media Development
Authority is closely monitoring developments at SingPost and will work
with its management to ensure postal services are not affected.</p>
