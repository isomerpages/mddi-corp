<h3>Parliament Sitting on 4 April 2022</h3>
<h2>QUESTION FOR ORAL ANSWER</h2>
<br>
<strong>35.&nbsp;Mr Yip Hon Weng:</strong> To ask the Minister for Communications and Information (a) why was the anti-SMS spoofing registry shut just about over a month after government agencies announced their intent to join the registry; (b) whether adequate time was given for the agencies to assess the new decision; (c) what are the ways by which the full-fledged Singapore SMS SenderID Registry will be superior; (d) how will it put us in line with international practices; and (e) what is the timeline for banks, government agencies and interested organisations to be fully onboarded.<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Answer:<br>
<br>
</strong>

<div>
<div>1.<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>The Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) and its&nbsp;subsidiary, the Singapore Network Information Centre (SGNIC), have set&nbsp;up a full-fledged Singapore SMS Sender ID Registry (SSIR) which&nbsp;commenced operations on 4 March 2022. It replaced the SMS Sender ID&nbsp;Registry pilot, which was started by IMDA and the Monetary Authority of&nbsp;Singapore in August 2021. The pilot was done in collaboration with the&nbsp;UK Mobile Ecosystem Forum (MEF).&nbsp;<br>
<br>
2.<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>Under the previous MEF's model, spoofed SMSes that use a&nbsp;registered Sender ID will still be received by consumers, until the Sender&nbsp;ID owner confirms that the spoofed SMSes are not legitimate and should&nbsp;be blocked. The new SSIR takes a more proactive approach. It can block&nbsp;spoofed SMSes upfront and provides greater control over anti-spoof&nbsp;measures that better protect Singaporeans. The pilot with MEF provided&nbsp;useful insights which has helped IMDA to set up the SSIR quickly. In&nbsp;addition, the SSIR will offer a more affordable pricing model to enable&nbsp;more widespread participation, especially for SMEs that are interested to&nbsp;sign up for the service.<br>
<br>
<div>3.<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>Internationally, Singapore is one of the first few countries to have&nbsp;implemented a national SMS Sender ID Registry to better prevent spoofed&nbsp;SMSes. 1. As of 30 March 2022, 25 organisations, including banks and&nbsp;government agencies, have joined the SSIR. Organisations such as the&nbsp;Association of Banks in Singapore, Mobile Network Operators, and SMS&nbsp;service providers are in full support of the SSIR, which continues to&nbsp;onboard new organisations interested in protecting their SMS Sender IDs.<br>
