<h3>Parliament Sitting on 11 November 2024</h3>
<h3>QUESTION FOR ORAL ANSWER</h3>
<p><strong>*50. Ms Tin Pei Ling</strong> asked the Minister for Digital Development
and Information (a) whether the Ministry expects local vernacular print
and digital media to continue projecting Singapore’s voice internationally;
and (b) whether sufficient funding is available to support such initiatives.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
</p>
<p>Our local vernacular print and digital media serve as important platforms
to amplify Singapore’s perspectives in the international domain, and reflect
our values and way of life to external audiences. This is in addition to
their primary responsibility of providing timely and trusted information
for all Singaporeans, catering especially to the needs of our vernacular
communities.</p>
<p>As previously shared with members, Government funding is provided to support
the vernacular capabilities of our Public Service Media entities, alongside
other areas such as talent and technological development. In doing so,
the Government works closely with both SPH Media and Mediacorp to ensure
resources are put to good use.</p>
