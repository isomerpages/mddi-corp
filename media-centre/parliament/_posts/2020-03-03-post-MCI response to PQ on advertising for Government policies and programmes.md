### Parliament Sitting on 3 March 2020

QUESTION FOR ORAL ANSWER
------------------------

**\*1. Mr Leon Perera:** To ask the Minister for Communications and Information what are the considerations used to decide whether and, in what way, to deploy print, TV or radio advertising to raise awareness of specific Government policies or programmes.   
  
**Answer:**

1. The Government uses a variety of online and offline platforms to ensure important information reaches different segments of our society.  These include television, radio, print, digital display panels, online platforms (websites, social media, WhatsApp) and ground outreach activities.  The choice of platforms is determined by a variety of factors, including the nature of the content, our target demographic segment, their media consumption habits and language preferences.   
  
2. For example, to raise awareness of the Merdeka Generation Package, MCI focused on traditional media (including television and radio as well as print), and engaged seniors face-to-face through Merdeka Generation roadshows, community events and home visits, given the profile of the target audience.   
  
3. For COVID-19 communication, MCI has used print, radio, television, digital display panels at HDB estates, Gov.sg social media sites and the dialect belt on Channel 8 to reach the widest possible audience.  MCI also uses Gov.sg WhatsApp to push out notifications in all four languages to more than 650,000 subscribers on case updates, as well as health advisories and corrections of misinformation.
