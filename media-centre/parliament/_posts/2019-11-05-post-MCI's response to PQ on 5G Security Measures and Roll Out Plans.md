### Parliament Sitting on 5 November 2019

QUESTION FOR WRITTEN ANSWER
---------------------------

**5\. Ms Rahayu Mahzam:** To ask the Minister for Communications and Information with regard to the impending rollout of 5G telecommunication services from 2020 (a) what are the measures put in place to ensure that 5G equipment manufacturers have met security requirements; and (b) whether there are plans to speed up the rollout of islandwide 5G networks by implementing more smaller, millimetre airwave networks in tandem with the two islandwide networks.  
  
**Answer:**  

1. Our vision is for Singapore to be a global frontrunner for innovation in secure 5G applications and services.  On 17 October 2019, IMDA announced its decision to allocate 5G spectrum via a Call for Proposal (CFP).  A key criterion is for applicants to demonstrate how their proposed 5G networks will be resilient and secure by design.  This includes meeting key resilience and security requirements stipulated by IMDA and subjecting their 5G equipment to independent security testing in accordance with international standards.  
  
2. Under the CFP process, IMDA will facilitate the deployment of two nationwide 5G networks, which will provide 5G coverage to at least half of Singapore by end-2022.  To complement this, IMDA is also allocating millimetre wave spectrum for the deployment of two additional localised 5G networks to compete for early business use cases and trial new service innovations.  This will allow consumers and businesses to benefit from 5G from as early as mid-2021.
