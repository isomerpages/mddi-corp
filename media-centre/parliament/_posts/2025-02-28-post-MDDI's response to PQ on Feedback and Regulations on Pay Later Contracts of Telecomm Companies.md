<h3>Parliament Sitting on 28 February 2025</h3>
<h3>QUESTION FOR ORAL ANSWER</h3>
<p><strong>*12. Dr Tan Wu Meng</strong> asked the Minister for Digital Development
and Information (a) whether the Government regulates telecommunications
companies' (telcos) transactions of “pay later” contracts with retail customers;
(b) whether any feedback has been received regarding telcos immediately
imposing heavy penalties when a customer defaults on a payment without
notification; and (c) if so, how many cases of such feedback have been
received since 2023.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
</p>
<p>Buy-now-pay-later plans are offered by telcos to consumers wishing to
pay for mobile devices in instalments. Such plans are common for many other
sectors and retail merchants. To safeguard consumer interest, the Infocomm
Media Development Authority (IMDA) requires telcos to ensure that consumers
acknowledge the terms and conditions, instalment charges, billing arrangements,
and penalties prior to consumers entering into purchase/service agreements.</p>
<p>Over the last two years, IMDA received 14 feedback from members of the
public on such instalment schemes. To date, telcos have assisted customers
in resolving their issues for all cases.</p>
