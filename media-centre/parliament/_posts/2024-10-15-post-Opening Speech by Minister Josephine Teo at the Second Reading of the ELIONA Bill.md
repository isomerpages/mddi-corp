<p><strong>SECOND READING OPENING SPEECH BY MINISTER JOSEPHINE TEO ON THE ELECTIONS (INTEGRITY OF ONLINE ADVERTISING) (AMENDMENT) BILL - 15 OCT 2024</strong>
</p>
<p><strong><u>Introduction</u></strong>
</p>
<p>1. Madam Deputy Speaker, I beg to move, “That the Bill be now read a second
time.”</p>
<p><strong><u>Threat of deepfakes to elections</u></strong>
</p>
<p>2. Madam, 2024 is a bumper year for elections around the world. Almost
half of the world’s population have gone or will go to the polls this year.</p>
<p>3. Unfortunately, there has been a noticeable increase of deepfake incidents
in countries where elections have taken place or are planned. Research
conducted by London-based tech company Sumsub suggests that the numbers
are alarming. In India, compared to a year ago, there are three times as
many deepfake incidents. In Indonesia, more than 15 times and in South
Korea, more than 16 times.<sup>1</sup>
</p>
<p>4. Earlier in January this year, a fake version of U.S. President Joe
Biden’s voice was featured in robocalls that sought to discourage Democrats
from participating in the New Hampshire Primary. The robocalls reached
thousands of people. The US Federal Communications Commission has since
declared AI-generated robocalls illegal, noting that they have the potential
to confuse consumers with misinformation. The telecommunications company
which transmitted the fake robocalls has been fined US$1 million, and the
individual behind it faces a fine of US$6 million and criminal charges.</p>
<p>5. During the Slovakian parliamentary elections last year, a deepfake
audio of a politician discussing electoral rigging was posted online. Unsurprisingly,
the audio went viral. Its impact was amplified by its timing – right before
Slovakia’s electoral “silence period”, which is like our cooling-off day.
The candidate lost the elections, despite having earlier led in the polls.
Did the deepfake audio contribute to his loss? No one can say with certainty,
but surely we prefer not to have elections subject to such incidents.</p>
<p><strong><u>Overseas jurisdictions and industry action</u></strong>
</p>
<p>6. Why have deepfake content proliferated? The short answer is that they
have become very easy and cheap to produce. With your permission, Mr Speaker,
may I play a video on the LED screens?</p>

<p><strong>Minister’s deepfake video presentation</strong>
</p>
<p>Hello, it’s been a busy day in the office, and I’ve just had a cup of
coffee.</p>
<p></p>
<p>(Pause) Did you think this was really me, Jo Teo, speaking in this video?
Actually, this is a deepfake generated by artificial intelligence.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It only took one person one hour to create this, using easily accessible
software that anyone can use right now from the Internet.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Imagine if someone produced realistic deepfakes, depicting Members of
this House saying or doing something we did not actually say or do, and
disseminated it. Such technology will only improve, and deepfakes may become
even more realistic, convincing, and easy to make.</p>

<p>7. Sir, Members will appreciate that AI technology is improving quickly.
If the deepfake video you just watched did not convince you of its impersonation
of me, more advanced versions soon will.</p>
<p>8. Around the world, countries have recognised the need to mitigate the
harms of deepfakes to their elections.</p>
<p>a. For example, South Korea revised its Public Official Election Act to
ban political campaign videos that use AI-generated content 90 days prior
to an election. Violations of the revised law, which took effect in January
this year, can lead to jail time of up to seven years, or a fine of up
to 50 million won, which is almost S$50,000. To date, 388 deepfakes have
been taken down by the National Election Commission of South Korea during
its elections.</p>
<p>b. Another example is Brazil, which has banned synthetic electoral propaganda
that will harm or favour any candidate during an election. The sanctions
include the revocation of the candidate’s registration or their mandate,
if they had been elected.</p>
<p>c. Last month, the state of California passed into law the “Defending
Democracy from Deepfake Deception Act of 2024”, which requires social media
platforms to block materially deceptive deepfakes of candidates from 120
days before the election to the day of the election.</p>
<p>d. The Australian government is also considering the advice of its Electoral
Commission to regulate the use of AI in elections, given the Commission’s
recent warning that it has limited scope to protect voters from deepfake
videos and phone calls imitating politicians in Australia’s upcoming elections.</p>
<p>9. It is not just Governments which are concerned. The tech industry has
also recognised the dangers of electoral deepfakes, and the importance
of ensuring voters can exercise their choice, free from AI-based manipulation.
Twenty leading tech companies, including Meta, Microsoft, OpenAI, and TikTok,
signed the Tech Accord at the Munich Security Conference in February, committing
to combat the deceptive use of AI in elections this year.</p>
<p><strong><u>Upholding the integrity of elections in Singapore</u></strong>
</p>
<p>10. In the face of these developments, Singaporeans are rightly concerned.
One study<sup>2 </sup>shows that more than 6 in 10 Singaporeans are worried
about the potential impact of deepfakes on the next election.</p>
<p>11. In a 2021 ruling on a case related to misinformation and online falsehoods,
our apex court had said: “It is simply incompatible with the core principles
of democracy to procure the outcome of an election to public office or
a referendum by trading in disinformation and falsehoods.”</p>
<p>12. Mr Speaker, I hope Members will agree that AI-generated misinformation
can seriously threaten our democratic foundations and demands an equally
serious response. The Elections (Integrity of Online Advertising) (Amendment)
Bill, or ELIONA, is our carefully calibrated response to augment our election
laws under the Parliamentary Elections Act and the Presidential Elections
Act, ensuring that the truthfulness of candidate representation and the
integrity of our elections continues to be upheld.</p>
<p><strong><u>Scope of the Bill</u></strong>
</p>
<p><em>Key legal requirements</em>
</p>
<p>13. Sir, I will now bring Members through the key aspects of the Bill.</p>
<p>14. The ELIONA Bill will amend our election laws to prohibit the publication
of content that:</p>
<p>a. is or includes online election advertising, or “OEA”;</p>
<p>b. Is digitally generated or manipulated; and</p>
<p>c. depicts a candidate saying or doing something that he or she did not
in fact say or do;</p>
