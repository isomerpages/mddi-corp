<h3>Parliament Sitting on 6 August 2024</h3>
<h3>QUESTION FOR WRITTEN ANSWER</h3>
<p><strong>37. Ms He Ting Ru</strong> asked the Minister for Digital Development
and Information (a) in each of the last five years, how many searches have
been conducted by members of the public on the Factually Government website;
(b) how many of such searches are related to falsehoods that are subject
to directions under POFMA; and (c) what is the breakdown of views by top
five topics of articles on the website.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
</p>
<p>We do not track the number of searches on the gov.sg website, which hosts
the Factually page. We can however identify the most viewed articles. The
top five most viewed Factually topics published between 2019 to 2023 in
descending order were on COVID-19, Ridout Road, fiscal policy, CPF and
public housing. Page views of COVID-19 articles are substantially higher
than other topics.</p>
