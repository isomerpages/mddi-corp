<h3>Parliament Sitting on 7 February 2024</h3>
<h3>QUESTION FOR WRITTEN ANSWER</h3>
<p><strong>1. Ms Hazel Poa: </strong>To ask the Prime Minister (a) whether
any attempts to breach Singpass facial verification have been detected
since it was launched; and (b) what safeguards and measures have been taken
to ensure that Singpass facial verification cannot be breached by deepfakes
or other clones generated by artificial intelligence.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Since the launch of facial verification on Singpass, the Government Technology
Agency (GovTech) has not detected breaches. Our agencies continuously monitor,
test and work on improvements. It is best we maintain operational security
over the technical details.</p>
</li>
</ol>
