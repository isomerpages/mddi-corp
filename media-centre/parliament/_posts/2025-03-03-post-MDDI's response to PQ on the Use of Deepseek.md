<h3>Parliament Sitting on 3 March 2025</h3>
<h3>QUESTION FOR ORAL ANSWER</h3>
<p><strong>*4. Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song</strong> asked the Minister for Digital
Development and Information (a) whether the Government is considering restrictions
on the use of DeepSeek by public officers, similar to bans imposed by some
other countries on its use on Government devices; (b) if not, what factors
justify a different approach in Singapore; and (c) how does the Government
determine which AI models are deemed secure enough for public sector use.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
</p>
<p>1. The Government has policies, frameworks and processes to guide the
use of technology in the public sector, including emerging technologies
like Artificial Intelligence (AI). This allows us to evaluate the suitability
of technologies for different use cases, based on factors such as performance,
security and resilience. This enables public sector agencies to use innovative
technologies effectively while ensuring the security and reliability of
government operations and functions.</p>
<p>2. We regularly review and update our policies to address the evolving
technological landscape and security considerations.</p>
