<p>1. Mr Chairman, many of us would find it hard to imagine our lives without
the Internet or digital devices. In a survey conducted by MDDI in 2023,
80 per cent of respondents agreed it was important for them to stay connected
to the Internet.</p>
<p>2. There are healthy ways of using digital technologies to enhance our
lives—just as there are unhealthy ways that open us up to risks. My speech
will focus on MDDI’s efforts to galvanise our community, to build a society
where citizens enjoy:</p>
<p>a. Access to digital services that are essential to daily living;</p>
<p>b. Proficiency in using digital technologies; and</p>
<p>c. Safe, healthy and positive digital experiences through a whole-of-society
effort.</p>
<p>3. I thank Mr Keith Chua for his interest in these efforts.</p>
<p><strong><u>Enhancing digital accessibility</u></strong>
</p>
<p>4. Let me start with access to digital technologies. Singapore is a highly
connected nation. 98 per cent of our resident households are connected
to the Internet. But we must pay attention to those who are at risk of
being left out.</p>
<p>5. The Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) helps those who cannot
afford it. Ms Hany Soh asked for an update on IMDA’s schemes.</p>
<p>a. DigitalAccess@Home has supported over 20,000 low-income households
with subsidised broadband access, a laptop or tablet, or both broadband
and a computing device since 2023.</p>
<p>b. The Mobile Access for Seniors scheme has also supported low-income
seniors with over 15,000 packages of subsidised smartphones and mobile
plans, or mobile plans only, since 2020.</p>
<p>6. Beyond connectivity and devices, day-to-day digital services need to
be user-friendly.</p>
<p>7. For some Singaporeans, like seniors and persons with disabilities,
navigating services which are not designed to meet their needs can be challenging;
a well-designed website or app can make a world of difference.</p>
<p>a. That is why SingPass was enhanced in 2022 to support features such
as Dark Mode and Screen Reader that enable those with visual impairments
to navigate SingPass with greater ease.</p>
<p>8. Mr Alex Yam asked about more efforts in this area. The Government takes
inclusive design seriously, and government agencies are expected to be
user-centric when designing their digital services. GovTech will do more
to support agencies in this.</p>
<p>a. This year, we are updating the Digital Service Standards, or DSS, which
guide agencies in designing user-friendly digital services.</p>
<p>b. The updated DSS will better explain international standards like the
Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) to agencies and provide recommendations
on how to meet these standards.</p>
<p>c. In addition, there will be greater emphasis on user testing before
launch for high-traffic government websites to make sure they are user-friendly.</p>
<p>9. We have also rolled out tools that agencies can use to support inclusive
design.</p>
<p>a. For example, GovTech developed the Oobee tool (previously known as
Purple A11y) which uses a bot to help agencies test how easy their websites
are to use and suggest improvements. GovTech will continue to enhance tools
to help agencies identify and resolve such issues.</p>
<p>10. These efforts provide agencies with stronger guidance and support
to develop digital services that are easy for all to use, regardless of
age or digital ability.</p>
<p>a. GovTech will provide dedicated support to agencies with high traffic
digital services.</p>
<p>11. But the Government cannot drive this effort alone. Today, Singaporeans
use a variety of commercial digital services daily. The private sector
plays an important part in designing user-friendly digital services. We
want to encourage and partner them in this.</p>
<p>a. The Oobee tool, which I mentioned earlier, is open-sourced and freely
available for private sector companies to use. We encourage more to make
use of this.</p>
<p>b. Last year, GovTech held the inaugural Co-Creation Lab, which brought
together representatives from government agencies, private sector companies
as well as community users. We were heartened to see so many partners step
forward to understand the challenges that seniors and persons with disabilities
face when using digital services such as making e-payments, using ride-hailing
apps and making healthcare appointments. These conversations helped service
providers identify improvements to their services to make them user-friendly.</p>
<p>12. The Co-Creation Lab demonstrated the need to strengthen partnerships
across the public, private and people sectors.</p>
<p>a. MDDI will launch a workgroup with partners from the public, private
and people sectors to co-create and co-deliver initiatives to develop digital
services that are more user-friendly. Details on this workgroup will be
announced later.</p>
<p>13. Even as we enhance the user-friendliness of digital services, we acknowledge
that some Singaporeans will need physical support to access Government
services. Dr Tan Wu Meng and Ms Denise Phua highlighted this in the budget
debate, and Mr Gerald Giam raised this in his cut.</p>
<p>a. Residents who need assistance with government digital transactions
can continue to get in-person assistance at government agencies’ physical
service touchpoints. Trained service ambassadors will assist less digitally
confident individuals with their transactions.</p>
<p>b. Residents can also visit ServiceSG Centres for assistance with 600
frequently used government services and schemes.</p>
<p>14. The Government will continue to be citizen-centric in our approach,
and make non-digital options available so that no one is left out.</p>
<p><strong><u>Uplifting digital proficiency for all</u></strong>
</p>
<p>15. Let me move on to digital skills. Two in three Singaporeans have basic
digital skills, and are able to carry out day-to-day tasks online, such
as buying products and services, searching for information, and making
contactless payments using a smartphone.</p>
<p>16. To set ourselves up well for the digital future, Singaporeans also
have to learn new technologies, such as Generative AI or “Gen AI” which
can help us with daily tasks. This upskilling is critical, as Ms Denise
Phua emphasised in the budget debate.</p>
<p>a. Without this, the increasing use of Gen AI around us, like how many
businesses now use chatbots to deliver customer services, can feel alien
and scary. To demystify Gen AI, we must understand its risks and limitations,
and learn how to use it responsibly.</p>
<p>17. The Government will continue to support less digitally-savvy citizens.
Mr Gerald Giam and Ms Hany Soh asked about Seniors Go Digital. The SG Digital
Office, or SDO, will continue to help citizens acquire the digital skills
needed for day-to-day living based on the Digital Skills for Life or DSL
framework. This prevents digital isolation, as Ms Rachel Ong raised in
the budget debate.</p>
<p>a. Since 2020, SDO has trained more than 370,000 seniors. 96 per cent
of seniors communicate online as of 2023, up from 87 per cent in 2017.</p>
<p>b. IMDA will be enhancing the DSL framework with content on Gen AI—explaining
the basics of it, its risks and how to manage them, and applications for
daily activities, like generating recommendations for places to eat at
or leisure activities to try. Interested learners can register for SDO
workshops or learn at their own pace through resources on the Digital for
Life Portal.</p>
<p>18. There are also many Singaporeans who are keen to embrace new technologies
like Gen AI.</p>
<p>19. Mr Alex Yam asked about new library initiatives to encourage tech
adoption. Over the next few years, our public libraries will be rolling
out showcases that allow the public to experience uses of Gen AI.</p>
<p>a. We hope that these showcases will demonstrate the practical value of
AI in daily life, excite citizens about these possibilities, and at the
same time help them understand the limitations and learn how to use AI
responsibly. Gen AI is a useful tool, but it cannot replace learning or
original thought.</p>
<p>20. These are just some of the activities that citizens can enjoy at our
public libraries as NLB celebrates its 30th anniversary in 2025. NLB will
host a series of “NLB30” events to mark 30 years and beyond of empowering
Singaporeans to read, learn and discover together. More details will be
announced later this year.</p>
<p>21. Sir, I will say a few words in Malay.</p>
<p>a. Antara cara terbaik untuk kita belajar menggunakan teknologi canggih
adalah melakukannya bersama dengan mereka yang berfikiran sama dengan kita.</p>
<p>b. Satu usaha perintis yang membuka peluang untuk masyarakat berkumpul
dan belajar bersama adalah Lorong AI. Ia adalah hab masyarakat yang memberi
ruang kepada mereka yang punyai persamaan dan minat serta kemahiran dalam
AI untuk meneroka bagaimana mereka boleh memacu pembangunan AI bersama.
Melalui wadah ini, mereka bertukar-tukar idea, dan membincangkan penemuan
baru. Mereka turut menghasilkan prototaip, dan meneroka penggunaan AI dalam
kehidupan seharian kita.</p>
<p>c. Encik Muhammad Zahari bin Abu Talib memainkan peranan penting dalam
Lorong AI. Selaku Ketua, beliau membantu menghubungkan individu, memulakan
perbincangan, dan menghubungkan kumpulan-kumpulan berbeza. Saya sendiri
dapat merasakan keghairahan mereka untuk belajar, berkongsi dan bekerjasama
semasa menghadiri salah satu sesi perkongsian AI Wednesdays anjuran Lorong
AI.</p>
<p>d. Dalam masyarakat Melayu/Islam kita, ramai yang sudah pun berjinak-jinak
menggunakan AI. Satu kumpulan bernama PEREKA, yang terdiri daripada para
pereka bentuk Melayu/Islam pelbagai bidang telah berkongsi bagaimana mereka
menggunakan AI bagi memperbaik hasil kerja mereka. Saya berpeluang bertemu
mereka baru-baru ini dan sangat teruja mendengarkan bagaimana mereka memanfaatkan
AI untuk mempertingkatkan proses kerja mereka. Tujuannya bukanlah untuk
menggantikan kreativiti manusia, tetapi bagi memudahkan proses penjanaan
idea, dan mengumpulkan maklumat. Semua ini bagi menghasilkan ciri-ciri
reka bentuk yang menepati nilai dan identiti budaya kita. Pada masa yang
sama, memastikan sentuhan manusia kekal menjadi teras sepanjang proses
mereka bentuk.</p>
<p>e. Saya amat berharap lebih banyak lagi kumpulan-kumpulan tempatan yang
dinamik seperti ini akan tampil. Agar mereka sama-sama dapat belajar dan
mencetuskan idea-idea menarik bagi memanfaatkan teknologi, demi kesejahteraan
rakyat Singapura.</p>
<p>22. Let me now turn to how we are equipping the future generation to benefit
from Gen AI.</p>
<p>a. We have an existing Code for Fun programme offered to all primary and
secondary schools, which exposes students to computational thinking through
coding, as well as inventive thinking through digital making. From this
year onwards, the Code for Fun programme will incorporate new AI for Fun
modules which provide students with hands-on opportunities to tinker with
AI technology.</p>
<p>b. For instance, primary school students will be taught how to use an
appropriate Gen AI platform to generate stories and images to create a
digital storyboard. Students will be taught the risks of Gen AI such as
biases and hallucinations, and the need to check AI-generated content against
other sources.</p>
<p>c. About 60 per cent of primary schools and 40 per cent of secondary schools
will introduce AI for Fun this year.</p>
<p>23. It is our endeavour to ensure that every Singaporean, regardless of
age, is encouraged to learn, use and have fun with new technologies in
an informed and responsible way.</p>
<p><strong><u>Fostering digital well-being, citizenry and safety for our community</u></strong>
</p>
<p>24. This brings me to the topic of online safety. Incidents that take
place online, like the generation and dissemination of deepfake nude photos,
cause real-life damage and are unacceptable.</p>
<p>25. About 74 per cent of Singaporeans had encountered harmful online content
in 2024. This has led some people to be fearful of the Internet, and how
it appears to be changing the fabric of our society. But it is important
to recognise that these harms are not caused by technology in itself but
by bad actors and bad behaviour.</p>
<p>26. The Government will do our part to reduce online risks. Minister Josephine
Teo earlier spoke about our regulations to make designated social media
services and app distribution services responsible for putting in place
safety measures to protect their users from harmful content.</p>
<p>a. However, regulations are not fool proof. Bans and age limits like those
being contemplated in other countries may sound compelling, but in reality,
there will always be ways to circumvent such rules and restrictions, as
Mr Eric Chua has pointed out.</p>
<p>27. Citizens must also take steps to protect themselves and their loved
ones online.</p>
<p>a. Parents play a critical role in guiding their child’s digital journey.
The Government shares parents’ concerns over excessive screen use and exposure
to online risks amongst children.</p>
<p>b. MOH’s updated guidance on screen use under Grow Well SG and the Parenting
for Wellness Initiative equip parents so that they can better protect their
children from inappropriate content and instil good screen use habits.
Parents can also find bite-sized resources on IMDA’s Digital for Life portal.
Members may refer to Handout A2 for a list of these resources.</p>
<p>c. A Positive Use Guide on Technology and Social Media will also be available
later this year.</p>
<p>28. Youths are a key group of citizens who shape online behaviour and
culture. Youths should be encouraged to use their influence to foster a
positive online environment.</p>
<p>a. I was encouraged to see students championing a kinder Internet at the
recent Digital Well-Being Roadshow at the Singapore Management University
(SMU). One booth featured an interactive game that showed participants
how to navigate online conversations and respond to their friends with
care and kindness. Over 650 students participated in the two-day Roadshow.</p>
<p>29. Toxic online discourse is worrying, because it undermines our ability
to understand one another, and disrupts our social cohesion. As Mr Alex
Yam mentioned, we must be civic-minded in the online space, just as how
we conduct ourselves in our shared physical spaces, like our neighbourhoods,
parks, and schools.</p>
<p>a. The Government is committed to exploring new ways to nurture a positive
online space. We will study issues like online polarisation that can negatively
impact our social cohesion, and explore ways to encourage a culture of
positivity and civic-mindedness online.</p>
<p>30. In the work that the Government does, it is always important to check
in on the sentiments of the community. This allows us to accurately identify
Singaporeans’ concerns, and aligns with their expectation of a responsive
government. Mr Gerald Giam shared his experience with surveys and asked
if they were commissioned by the Government. It is unfortunate that the
pollster did not disclose to Mr Giam the identity of the commissioning
party for the survey. Without the benefit of seeing the actual questionnaire,
it is difficult to say for sure that the surveys were conducted by the
Government.</p>
<p>a. In MDDI’s case, we conduct regular polls to gauge the public’s awareness
of scams as well as the quality of mainstream and online media, and the
public’s news consumption habits. When asked by respondents, our representatives
would identify MDDI as the commissioning agency for the surveys. We conduct
the media polls to help Government agencies to adjust their public communications
efforts to better reach target segments on key national policies. They
also help shape our public broadcast funding. The poll findings on scams
help MDDI to shape our policies to tackle online harm.</p>
<p>b. The findings from Government-commissioned surveys are shared publicly
when it is useful to do so. However, as the surveys are commissioned primarily
to shape public policy, not all findings are suitable for public release.</p>
<p>c. As to Mr Giam’s concern that Government-commissioned surveys could
be used for non-public policy purposes, funding for such surveys are subject
to the same governance requirements as other forms of public expenditure
undertaken by government agencies.</p>
<p><strong><u>Conclusion</u></strong>
</p>
<p>31. To conclude, Mr Chairman, we invite everyone — individuals, companies
and community organisations — to become a partner of the Digital for Life
movement, and join us in our efforts to help Singapore build an inclusive
and cohesive digital society. All of us have a part to play in making our
online space a safe, healthy and positive one.</p>
