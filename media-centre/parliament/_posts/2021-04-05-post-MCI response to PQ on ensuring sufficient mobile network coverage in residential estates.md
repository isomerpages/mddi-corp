### Parliament Sitting on 5 April 2021

QUESTION FOR WRITTEN ANSWER
---------------------------

**73**. Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling: To ask the Minister for Communications and Information (a) how does IMDA ensure mobile network operators (MNOs) provide sufficient coverage for users in residential estates or public areas especially at underground MRT stations; and (b) whether IMDA will consider assisting with a standard contract template that can be used by MNOs and building owners (private condominiums) to fairly address the concerns of installations.

**Answer:**

1. All mobile network operators (MNOs) must comply with IMDA’s standards for nationwide mobile coverage under IMDA’s Quality of Service Framework, which covers outdoor and indoor areas, including MRT stations and tunnels.  IMDA conducts regular island-wide tests to ascertain that the MNOs have met and continue to meet these standards.  The results from these tests are published on IMDA’s website.  Where there are complaints of poor coverage in specific areas, IMDA requires the MNOs to investigate each complaint and make all reasonable efforts to improve coverage in a timely manner.   
  
2. On installation, given the importance of mobile connectivity services to Singapore, IMDA has put in place a Code of Practice for Info-communication Facilities in Buildings.  The Code of Practice specifies procedures to be observed by both MNOs and building owners for the deployment of mobile network equipment in buildings.  This Code of Practice may be used by both parties as the baseline for contractual terms governing such deployments.  IMDA expects MNOs to work with building owners to address concerns relating to the deployments, and achieve an amicable outcome.
