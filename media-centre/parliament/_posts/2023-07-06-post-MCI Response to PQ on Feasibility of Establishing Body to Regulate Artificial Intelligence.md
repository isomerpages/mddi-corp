### Parliament Sitting on 6 July 2023

QUESTION FOR ORAL ANSWER
------------------------

**13\. Ms Tin Pei Ling:** To ask the Minister for Communications and Information (a) whether the Government will be studying the feasibility of establishing a new body to regulate artificial intelligence (AI) in Singapore; and (b) what are the efforts made in working with other governments to coordinate responsible development and deployment of AI.  
  
**Answer:**

1. Singapore supports the responsible development and deployment of AI to unlock its transformative potential on our economy and society. Our governance approach is a practical and risk-based one, as explained at the 21 Apr 2023 and 9 May 2023 sittings.

2. AI is fast becoming a general-purpose technology that is applied in a wide array of sectors and use cases. We cannot adopt a one-size-fits-all approach to regulate it, nor can we anticipate every risk out there. 

3. Nonetheless, the Government hopes to see AI deployed in a responsible and ethical way, aligned with international norms.

4. The Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) and the Personal Data Protection Commission (PDPC) have introduced guidelines to guide the development and deployment of AI: 

    (a)  In 2019, PDPC published the Model AI Governance Framework, to turn AI ethical principles into implementable business practices, for companies to safely deploy AI solutions; 

    (b) IMDA has open-sourced AI Verify, an AI governance testing framework and software toolkit. It strengthens trust by enabling objective validation of a company’s implementation of responsible AI. It is a minimum viable product that we hope to grow over time.

    (c)  Later this year, PDPC will be issuing Advisory Guidelines on the Use of Personal Data in AI Systems to offer guidance on how the Personal Data Protection Act will apply to the collection and use of personal data in AI systems for decision-making, predictions or recommendations to an individual.

5. These guidelines have received support internationally and from industry partners, as practical steps to think about how to use AI responsibly. We will continue to monitor developments and are prepared to adjust our implementation approach as the space evolves.   
  
6. AI governance is an area that benefits from more international cooperation and understanding. To support this, Singapore is engaging widely with our international partners through multilateral platforms such as the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence (GPAI). As the upcoming Chair of the 4th ASEAN Digital Ministers Meeting (ADGMIN), Singapore hopes to work with our ASEAN Member States to develop an ASEAN Guide on AI Governance and Ethics.  
  
7. We are also engaging other like-minded partners, such as Israel, the Republic of Korea, and the UK, with whom we have signed MOUs to cooperate on AI and emerging technologies. With the US, we have been partnering with their National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to advance our alignment on AI governance.
