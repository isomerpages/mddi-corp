<h3>Parliament Sitting on 8 May 2024</h3>
<h3>QUESTION FOR WRITTEN ANSWER</h3>
<p><strong>*19. Dr Tan Wu Meng </strong>asked the Prime Minister (a) whether
the Government will consider requiring all public sector e-services including
smartphone apps to pass minimum usability tests for user interface and
user experience; and (b) if so, whether these minimum standards can be
decided with consultation among the Agency for Integrated Care, the Ministry
of Social and Family Development, social workers, civil service organisations
and volunteers of senior citizenry including Silver Guardians.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>The Government is committed to delivering public digital services which
are user-friendly and accessible.</p>
<p>First, the Digital Service Standards (DSS) helps agencies design and develop
digital services that are (a) accessible and inclusive, (b) usable and
(c) relevant. The DSS incorporates the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
(WCAG), which is a set of international standards to increase the accessibility
of web content for seniors and persons with disabilities.</p>
<p>Second, in addition to meeting the WCAG standards, the DSS further encourages
agencies to conduct usability checks prior to implementing their digital
services. Besides engaging their target users directly, agencies can tap
on the Smart Nation Ambassador Citizens Co-Creation Group which includes
representatives from diverse groups such as persons with disabilities,
low-income families and seniors.</p>
<p>Third, to support agencies in this effort, GovTech conducts regular independent
usability checks on frequently used online services to help agencies identify
areas of improvement. In addition, GovTech provides agencies with central
diagnostic tools such as the (a) Whole-of-Government Application Analytics
(WOGAA) tool which automates real-time reporting of metrics such as transaction
completion rate, customer satisfaction, and (b) Purple A11y, which helps
agencies identify and rectify parts of their websites which persons with
disabilities may find hard to access.</p>
<p>The processes are in place so that government online services are user-friendly
and accessible. We welcome specific suggestions or observations that can
help us improve further.</p>
