<h3>Parliament Sitting on 13 November 2024</h3>
<h3>QUESTION FOR WRITTEN ANSWER</h3>
<p><strong>21. Ms Hazel Poa</strong> asked the Minister for Digital Development
and Information (a) why it is the established practice for the Government
to approach mainstream media outlets to correct inaccurate information
instead of issuing a correction direction under the Protection from Online
Falsehood and Manipulation Act 2019 (POFMA); and (b) why does the Government
not provide non-mainstream media outlets or other persons with the opportunity
to correct inaccurate information before issuing a correction direction
under POFMA.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
</p>
<p>The Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act 2019 (POFMA)
allows the Government to address online falsehoods expeditiously, by requiring
the correct facts to be put up alongside the falsehood. This establishes
an honest and factual basis for public discourse on issues of public interest.</p>
<p>Accredited media outlets have long established practices to publish editorâ€™s
notes or corrections if there are inaccuracies in their reports. Such processes
allow the Government to work with accredited media to quickly clarify any
factual errors in a timely manner. Non-accredited media outlets, as well
as individuals, do not have such established processes for clarifications
and corrections to be made.</p>
