<h3>Parliament Sitting on 12 November 2024</h3>
<h3>QUESTION FOR ORAL ANSWER</h3>
<p><strong>*29. Mr Saktiandi Supaat </strong>asked the Minister for Digital
Development and Information in light of the lawsuit filed by Delta Air
Lines against cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike (a) what are the status and
expected timelines of the study being done by the Ministry’s internal taskforce
that was set up in the aftermath of the 19 July 2024 disruption; and (b)
whether any agency which has suffered losses will be initiating or joining
in legal proceedings against CrowdStrike.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
</p>
<p>The Ministry’s internal taskforce has completed its study of the incident
and distilled lessons, particularly relating to software supply chain risks
and patch management. The Cyber Security Agency of Singapore will be issuing
advisories on them in due course. The taskforce also identified enhancements
to improve incident response when such disruptions occur, and to strengthen
the resilience of our Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) and Foundational
Digital Infrastructure (FDI). Work by the respective Ministry of Digital
Development and Information agencies and other Government stakeholders
are underway.</p>
<p>As updated to Parliament previously, the Crowdstrike incident did not
significantly affect our CII or FDI. The impact to other entities has also
been relatively modest. In any case, it is up to affected entities to decide
whether or not to take legal action against Crowdstrike or their intermediaries.</p>
<p>Not all disruptions can be prevented, nor will their impact be equally
severe. Nonetheless, it is important to have the plans in place to recover
quickly from unexpected disruptions, and to have business continuity plans.
I encourage all businesses to step up their efforts by tapping resources
such as SingCERT’s advisory on building digital resilience, CSA’s cybersecurity
toolkits and cybersecurity roadmaps in Infocomm Media Development Authority’s
Industry Digital Plans.</p>
