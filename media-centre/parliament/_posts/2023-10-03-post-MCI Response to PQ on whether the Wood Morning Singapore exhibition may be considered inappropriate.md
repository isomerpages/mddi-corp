##### Parliament Sitting on 3 October 2023

##### QUESTION FOR WRITTEN ANSWER

  
**28. Mr Christopher de Souza:** To ask the Minister for Communications and Information with reference to the Wood Morning Singapore exhibition by a local toy company depicting children's cartoon characters and toys in what may be considered an inappropriate manner (a) whether a licence is required before such an exhibition can be held; (b) if so, whether a licence was issued for the said exhibition; and (c) if a licence was issued, why. 

  

**Answer:**

1. “Wood Morning Singapore” is a display held within a store, “BLAXK” by ActionCity, at Funan shopping mall. The store display features toy figurines and other merchandise which are available for sale. An Arts Entertainment Licence is not required for displays within commercial venues where the primary purpose is to sell the items. 

  

2. MCI has received public feedback expressing concerns regarding the display. Shopping mall management and tenants should consider public acceptance of items on display especially if they are visible to young children. MCI has conveyed the feedback to ActionCity and the management of Funan shopping mall. 

  

3. We also understand that police reports have been lodged and Police are looking into the matter.
