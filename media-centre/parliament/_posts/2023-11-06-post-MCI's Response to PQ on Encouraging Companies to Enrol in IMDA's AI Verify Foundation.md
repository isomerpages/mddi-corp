##### Parliament Sitting on 6 November 2023

##### QUESTION FOR WRITTEN ANSWER

**100. Ms See Jinli Jean**: To ask the Minister for Communications and Information (a) what are the plans to ensure that companies with artificial intelligence (AI) driven business models such as platform companies are enrolled into IMDA's AI Verify Foundation that seeks to uphold responsible and ethical use of AI; and (b) whether the Government will consider (i) a reporting channel for consumers who are subjected to companies’ irresponsible use of AI and (ii) a tripartism approach to shaping rules in using AI for work and workforce management.

**Answer:**

1.     Singapore supports the responsible development and deployment of Artificial Intelligence (AI) across all settings.

2.     Though there is broad agreement that processes and outcomes should be explainable, transparent, fair and human-centric, technical standards for responsible AI are still in the nascent stage of development. 

Nevertheless, to promote responsible AI use, the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) has introduced guidelines and tools for owners and developers of AI systems. This includes (a) the **Model AI Governance Framework** in 2019; and (b) **AI Verify** in 2022 – a voluntary testing framework and software toolkit that helps companies (i) objectively validate the performance of their AI systems against responsible AI principles, and (ii) demonstrate this to their stakeholders through the sharing of testing reports.

3.     AI Verify can therefore be a useful basis for unions to engage employers or labour market intermediaries on the use of AI that impact workers. In fact, early adopters of AI Verify include online HR services platform XOPA.ai.

4.     As for reporting channels, this would depend on the specific concerns.  For example, reports concerning employment discrimination as a result of AI use should continue to be channelled to the **Ministry of Manpower** or the **Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices** (TAFEP) for assessment and follow up. For insurance- or banking-related concerns, reports can be directed to the **Monetary Authority of Singapore**.
