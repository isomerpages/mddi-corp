<h3>Parliament Sitting on 13 November 2024</h3>
<h3>QUESTION FOR WRITTEN ANSWER</h3>
<p><strong>22. Ms He Ting Ru</strong> asked the Minister for Digital Development
and Information (a) what is the estimated total of AI-specific computing
power currently available in Singapore's data centres; (b) whether there
are plans to establish a national cloud for AI research and education;
(c) if so, what percentage of this computing power does it aim to secure;
(d) what legal frameworks are being considered to mandate contributions
from private AI data centres to such a national cloud; and (e) how do these
potential frameworks compare to those in other leading AI nations.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
</p>
<p>Singapore is a regional data centre hub with a total capacity exceeding
1.4 gigawatts. We have one of the highest concentrations of data centres
in the region, and our operational data centre capacity per capita exceeds
that of regional markets such as Beijing, Hong Kong, Seoul, Sydney and
Tokyo. To support continued growth and innovation in Singapore, we aim
to provide at least 300 megawatts of additional capacity in the near term
and more through working with industry to explore green energy deployments.
The amount of AI-specific compute resources available in these data centres
depends on the workloads that the private and public sectors expect to
process and how these workloads are distributed. It changes dynamically
in response to needs and available alternatives.</p>
<p>Our compute needs for AI research are being met through a combination
of on-premise and commercial cloud capacities. This approach is more responsive
to demand than mandating contributions from private data centres.</p>
<p>The National Supercomputing Centre (NSCC) is a significant contributor
to the compute resources available for our research ecosystem, including
for AI research. The launch of the ASPIRE 2A and 2A+ research supercomputers
in October 2024, which have 30 PFLOPS of aggregated compute power, will
help to address the growing demand for high performance computing resources,
complement existing infrastructure, and enable new research opportunities.
NSCC is also developing the next supercomputer that will enhance Singapore’s
high performance computing capabilities to support national research initiatives.</p>
<p>Developing Singapore’s compute infrastructure is vital to support our
National AI Strategy 2.0 ambitions. We are actively working with industry
partners to avail access to the compute resources needed to maintain our
global competitiveness.</p>
