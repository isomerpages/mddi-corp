<h3>Parliament Sitting on 29 February 2024</h3>
<h3>QUESTION FOR WRITTEN ANSWER</h3>
<p><strong>13. Mr Shawn Huang Wei Zhong: </strong>To ask the Minister for
Communications and Information (a) whether he can provide an update on
the current state of telecommunications mobile coverage and quality of
service especially in new towns; (b) how does the Ministry monitor and
ensure the quality of mobile services provided by telecommunication companies;
and (c) what benchmarks or standards are put in place to measure and maintain
high-quality mobile coverage.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Mobile network operators (MNOs) are required to provide at least 99% nationwide
coverage in outdoor areas, including those inside road and MRT tunnels,
and at least 85% coverage within buildings.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In fact, it is rare for such&nbsp; mandatory quality-of-service standards
for mobile-network coverage, and Singapore is one of only a few countries
to require it. Based on audits conducted regularly, all MNOs have complied
with the standards. In new HDB towns, MNOs and HDB work closely together
to facilitate mobile-network coverage for new flats as soon as practicable,
after construction is completed.</p>
</li>
</ol>
