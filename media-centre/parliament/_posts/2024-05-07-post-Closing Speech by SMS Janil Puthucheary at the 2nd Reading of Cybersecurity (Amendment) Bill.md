<p><strong><u>Introduction</u></strong>
</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Mr Speaker, I thank Members for their interest in and strong support for
the Bill.</p>
<p>a. All Members who spoke have given strong support for the Bill. Several
Members noted the rise in cyber threats both in Singapore and around the
world and that this has become a growing concern amongst Singaporeans.</p>
<p>b. Mr Gerald Giam, Mr Alex Yam, and Mr Darryl David spoke about the potentially
devastating impact that a successful attack on our CII could have on the
lives of Singaporeans. Ms Hany Soh spoke about recent major cybersecurity
incidents and their serious consequences, while Mr Desmond Choo said that
it was crucial that we have robust and regularly-updated cybersecurity
laws against the increase in cyber threats. I agree.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As the cyber threats we face intensify, it is clear that there is agreement
in this House on the timeliness of this Bill, and the need to put CSA in
a better position to safeguard Singapore’s cybersecurity.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mr Melvin Yong spoke about the urgent need to tackle scams. The Government
agrees. In January 2024, Minister Josephine Teo spoke about Building an
Inclusive and Safe Digital Society, and outlined what the Government is
doing to combat scams, so I will not belabour those points. The Cybersecurity
Act is not aimed at tackling scams. Even so, <u>Clause 7</u> of the Bill
will allow us to take a stronger stance against impersonation scams, by
making it an offence for any person to use CSA’s gazetted symbols or representations
without the Commissioner’s prior written permission.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cybersecurity threats are ever evolving. Mr Melvin Yong also spoke about
the need to secure operational technology (OT) systems. The cybersecurity
of OT is a nascent field, but it is already one of CSA’s key areas of work
as part of its national cybersecurity mission. CSA has established thought
leadership when it published the OT Cybersecurity Masterplan in 2019, which
is a strategic blueprint to guide Singapore’s efforts to foster a resilient
and secure cyber environment for our OT CII. CSA also organises the OT
Cybersecurity Expert Panel Forum every year, which is a platform for cybersecurity
practitioners, operators, researchers, and policy makers to discuss governance
policies, best practices and trends related to OT cybersecurity.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Members who have spoken today have raised several important considerations
relating to the Bill, and I would summarise them into three groups:</p>
<p>a. First, are the compliance costs arising from the cybersecurity measures
introduced by the Bill justified?</p>
<p>b. Secondly, will the new obligations be operationalised in a sensible
and practical manner?</p>
<p>c. Finally, will there be safeguards in place to prevent abuse, as the
Bill expands CSA’s powers?</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let me address these considerations in turn.</p>
<p><em><u>Are the compliance costs justified?</u></em>
</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some Members raised concerns about the additional costs of regulatory
compliance. Some have suggested that such costs could even adversely impact
the community of SMEs in Singapore, or industry development more generally.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To clarify, neither the Cybersecurity Act nor the amendments proposed
in this Bill impose cybersecurity obligations on the business community
at large. What the Act and amendments proposed in the Bill seek to do is
regulate only the cybersecurity of systems, infrastructure and services
that are important at a national level, because their disruption or compromise
could affect our survival, security, safety, or other national interests.
This is a known and finite set of systems and entities. Our approach is
a targeted and calibrated one, precisely because we recognise that regulation
will involve compliance costs.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With the amendments covered in the Bill, the Cybersecurity Act will only
be imposing obligations on four groups of entities:</p>
<p>a. The first is providers of essential services, whether they are Critical
Information Infrastructure (CII) owners or rely on third party vendors
for the CII. Securing the computers and computer systems that are necessary
for the continuous delivery of our essential services is a matter of national
security and survival.</p>
<p>b. The second group comprises owners of Systems of Temporary Cybersecurity
Concern (STCC). Where there is loss of a computer system, even a system
established on a temporary basis, would have a serious detrimental effort
on Singapore’s national interests, CSA must be allowed to proactively oversee
the cybersecurity of such systems.</p>
<p>c. The third group comprises Entities of Special Cybersecurity Interest
(ESCI). The ESCIs. This is because we need them to be cybersecure if their
computer systems contain sensitive information or they perform functions
which if disrupted will have a significant detrimental effect on our national
interests.</p>
<p>d. The last group comprises major providers of Foundational Digital Infrastructure
(FDI) services, because disruption to these FDI services that FDI service
providers provide could have knock-on disruptions to Singapore-based organisations
and Singaporeans who rely on them for their business operations, work and
lives.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some compliance cost cannot be avoided when regulation is concerned. It
is something we are mindful of, we do not seek to regulate without good
reason. For these four groups, it was a considered decision that <strong>we must have the necessary legislation in place to govern their cybersecurity because our national security and other national interests are at stake.</strong>
</p>
<p>a. Cyber attacks can have serious consequences. Where essential services
are concerned, lives and livelihoods can be affected. Attacks like these
can also indirectly hurt the reputation of the organisation or Singapore,
and can have an external, impact on the customers and business partners
of the victim organisation. These are in addition to potential direct financial
costs - according to some reports, the average cost of a cyber attack on
an organisation with more than one thousand employees is around S$71,000,
and one in eight firms suffered costs of S$330,000 or more.</p>
<p>b. These security reasons are also why I had caveated in my Opening Speech
that I will not disclose any specific real-life examples of the critical
systems and entities we seek to regulate, which includes ESCIs. I seek
Ms Ng Ling Ling’s understanding that I will not respond directly to her
query on the entities that will be designated as ESCI. Ms Hany Soh asked
whether there would be circumstances that go toward publication or disclosure
of an ESCI’s identity - this will be on a case-by-case basis, and we must
keep the security of the ESCI in mind.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The issue for consideration is not whether a regulated entity is a large
company, an MNC or a SME. The key consideration is whether a cyber attack
on the entity could have serious implications on our national security
or other national interests. We do not take these decisions to impose obligations
lightly. For instance, we are proposing the expansion of the incident reporting
requirements for CII owners under Part 3 because the evidence shows that
malicious actors are using CII-adjacent systems and supply chains to attack
the CII, and we need to stay situationally aware of what is happening around
the CII in order to keep the CII itself safe.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mr Mark Lee seemed to have the impression that the Bill only focuses on
“personal information” and does not protect other types of confidential
business information. This is not the case. The Cybersecurity Act does
not differentiate between protecting personal information and business
information, as the cybersecurity of all information in a CII must not
be compromised. The Bill will do the same for the new categories of systems
and entities we are proposing to regulate for cybersecurity.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mr Sharael Taha asked about how we would address the cybersecurity threats
posed by machine learning and generative AI. The Act and this Bill allow
CSA to compel regulated entities to take the necessary measures to mitigate
cyber risks, regardless of the technologies used by the regulated entities,
or by malicious actors to perpetuate their attacks. The AI landscape is
still developing and relatively nascent. CSA will continue to monitor our
threat landscape carefully, work with regulated entities to take the necessary
steps to protect themselves and address the challenges as the technology
emerges and become clearer.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I would also like to clarify that not all the amendments add to the operating
costs of regulated entities and systems. Some of the key amendments I covered
in my Opening Speech will allow CII owners to make use of new technologies
and new business models. This can result in efficiencies while maintaining
the cybersecurity of the CII. These include the use of commercial cloud
solutions, and demand-aggregated system infrastructure owned by a third
party. These could be business opportunities as Mr Neil Parekh observed
in his speech.</p>
<p><em><u>How will CSA ensure that the new obligations are operationalised in a sensible and practical manner?</u></em>
</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How CSA will ensure that the new obligations are operationalised in a
sensible and practical manner?</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The technologies are constantly advancing, and changes our business and
operating context. Malicious actors are inventive, and continually find
new ways to compromise their targets. Several members have asked questions
about how the amendments would be implemented. Underlying their questions
is an important consideration – will CSA operationalise these new laws
sensibly and give regulated entities support to meet their statutory obligations?
The short answer to both is yes, but I am going to give a slightly longer
answer.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CSA understands the need to take into account business realities and to
be practical and sensible when implementing the Act. CII owners and other
industry stakeholders representing potential ESCIs and major FDI service
providers were consulted extensively. Many trade associations and chambers
provided their views during the consultation process.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CSA’s practice is, has been, and will be, to provide ample support to
our regulated entities, by ‘walking with them towards compliance’.</p>
<p>a. This begins even before a system or an entity is designated. Where
CSA has reason to believe that a system or entity should be designated,
CSA’s general practice has been to first engage the system owner or the
entity to better understand their operating context such as the cybersecurity
measures already implemented and their level of cybersecurity capabilities
to ensure that any designation is appropriate. Subsequently, CSA will then
work with the system owner or entity to assess what needs to be done for
the entity or system to be in compliance with the Act, as well as the support
and lead time that the organisation will need. I hope this addresses Mr
Mark Lee’s, Mr Neil Parekh’s and Ms Hany Soh’s clarifications on the designation
process, Ms Tin Pei Ling’s question on how we can calibrate our implementation
approach and Ms Joan Pereira’s query on whether all ancillary or supporting
infrastructure will be designated as STCCs for high-profile, high-security
or high-level events in Singapore. We will only make such decisions after
fully understanding the context and how the relevant systems are designed.</p>
<p>b. CSA will also consider waivers of the application of a code of practice
or standard of performance on a designated entity where possible on a case-by-case
basis, to account for specific operating contexts, or the developmental
journey of the organisation in question.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As Mr Sharael Taha noted, our CII supply chains are getting more complex.
If a breach occurs to a supplier’s system that is not directly interconnected
with or communicates with a CII, the Bill will not require the owner of
the compromised system to report such breaches to CSA. Mr Darryl David
asked how we would manage, if vendors and suppliers to our CIIs are not
directly obliged by statute to disclose cybersecurity incidents. The principle
we apply is that CII owners are responsible for the security and resilience
of their essential services. That means that it is in their interest and
it is also their responsibility to be situationally aware of supply chain
attacks that could affect their CII and report such incidents to CSA when
they become aware of them. It was a deliberate decision on the Government’s
part not to compel reporting of cybersecurity incidents from all the suppliers
of a CII owner to CSA directly. Doing so would add the reporting burden
to more parties and may not be directly useful for enhancing the security
of the CII itself, which ultimately is what all this work is focused on.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where the CII is owned by a third party, Clause 14 requires the provider
of essential service from the third-party vendor to obtain legally-binding
commitments from the vendor that would put the provider in a position to
discharge its statutory obligations, so that the cybersecurity of the CII
is not compromised.</p>
<p>a. Mr Louis Ng asked several questions relating to how the Government
would ensure that we would have sufficient levers against such a third
party. The intent behind these provisions is to allow the provider of essential
service to consider market solutions from third parties, so that they can
be more efficient in the provision of their essential services, without
compromising cybersecurity. It is not to indirectly regulate these third
parties.</p>
<p>b. Where the third party is unwilling or unable, as Mr Darryl David noted
could happen, CSA could direct the provider of essential services to stop
using the system owned by that third party under the provisions in new <u>Sections 16E(2), 16H(2), 16I(2) and 16J(2)</u>.</p>
<p>c. Ms Joan Pereira asked if it would be feasible for CSA to require a
provider of essential services to cease using a third party vendor on the
market. Ultimately, what Part 3A seeks to do is to ensure that providers
of essential services who use a third party’s system do so without compromising
cybersecurity. Where a provider of essential services faces certain constraints,
CSA is prepared to work with them on possible arrangements that could be
made. However, if there are no solutions on the market that are adequately
secure, the provider of essential services should take responsibility for
building the CII it needs. The security of our essential services cannot
and should not be compromised.</p>
<p>d. In response to Mr Desmond Choo’s question on data security when CII
owners move to the Cloud, CSA will work with CII owners to conduct cybersecurity
risk assessments of any migration of a CII to the Cloud. The principle
remains – they must be able to meet their statutory obligations with respect
to the cybersecurity of the CII regardless of the operating model.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The same principle applies to Ms Tin Pei Ling’s and Mr Gerald Giam’s questions
about overseas CII. Under the new Part 3 provisions proposed by the Bill,
the owner of the CII will be held responsible for the cybersecurity of
their CII. It does not matter whether the CII is located in Singapore,
or located wholly overseas and designated under the new Section 7(1A).
Section 7(1A) only applies when the owner is in Singapore. Similarly, the
new Part 3A applies to a provider of essential service located in Singapore,
who will be held responsible for the cybersecurity of the CII that they
rely on. It does not matter whether the CII owned by the third- party is
located in Singapore, or located wholly overseas. The obligations are placed
on the CII owner or the provider of essential service in Singapore, so
there is no extra-territoriality enforcement of the provisions in new Part
3 and Part 3A.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mr Yip Hon Weng asked how we will deal with the cross-border nature of
FDI services such as cloud services and data centre operations. We have
designed the new provisions to account for this.</p>
<p>a. For example, where cloud computing is concerned, it is entirely possible
that the cloud services provided to the Singapore market are provided using
infrastructure that can be located in any part of the world. In fact, the
ability to tap on infrastructure from any part of the world is a key value
proposition of cloud computing because it bolsters the resilience of a
given cloud service. Thus, the focus of our proposed laws is not to insist
that designated major FDI service providers report cybersecurity incidents
affecting all their digital infrastructure around the world. Rather, new
Section 18M will require them to report only prescribed incidents that
result in the disruption or degradation of the designated provider’s FDI
service in Singapore, or has a significant impact on the designated provider’s
business operations in Singapore.</p>
<p>b. Mr Yip Hon Weng also asked if the designated providers of major FDI
service will be held responsible for breaches occurring in overseas data
centres if they disrupt their services in Singapore. Sir, I would like
to make it quite clear that the Act, even if amended by the Bill, does
not penalise victims of cyber attacks for being attacked. The statutory
duties under the Act only require the designated provider to work with
CSA to prevent and mitigate the cybersecurity risks by, for instance, reporting
cybersecurity incidents, and complying with the necessary cybersecurity
standards and written directions.</p>
<p>c. Penalties would apply when there is wilful non-compliance. Mr Neil
Parekh asked about the types of penalties that could be imposed. If the
proposed amendments are passed, such penalties could be criminal or civil
in nature. Ms Hany Soh asked what factors would be taken into consideration
on the penalties to impose for non-compliance – in making a recommendation
to the Public Prosecutor, CSA will consider a range of factors, including
the risks created by the non-compliance, the egregiousness, the facts of
the case.</p>
<p>d. Ms Razwana Begum asked how we would enforce the provisions relating
to major FDI service providers if many of the providers are based overseas.
Indeed, this could be the case for the cloud service sector. To facilitate
enforcement, new Section 18G(6) requires a designated major FDI service
provider who is located outside of Singapore to appoint a person in Singapore
to accept service of notices or directions under the Act.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Several Members pointed out that some of the operational details are not
contained within the Bill. Matters relating to the technical or other standards
that regulated entities must meet, and how CII owners should work with
the providers of cloud services they use, will be designed to reflect current
business realities and prevailing industry norms. What the Bill does is
to allow CSA to address these in codes of practice or standards of performance
and subsidiary legislation, so that we can be more agile in reflecting
the operating context. CSA will be consulting industry on these matters,
if the Bill is passed.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many Members like Ms Ng Ling Ling, Ms Jean See, and Mr Melvin Yong also
gave suggestions on how the Government can provide more support to regulated
entities to help them comply with their statutory obligations and provide
some assurance that their cybersecurity measures are adequate. We will
consider these suggestions very carefully. As CSA operationalises the new
amendments, CSA will continue to take onboard stakeholder feedback. Where
appropriate and feasible, CSA will harmonise the cybersecurity standards
and incident reporting parameters to be imposed under the Act with international
practices.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mr Gerald Giam asked about step-in rights and CSA’s incident response
frameworks. I understand the concern to be whether CSA is adequately empowered
to respond effectively to cybersecurity incidents and do what it takes
to secure our CII. Part 4 of the 2018 Act already provides CSA with the
necessary powers to respond to cybersecurity threats and incidents and
to take appropriate measures to secure the threatened or attacked system.
Operationally, CSA and the DIS of the SAF have an excellent working relationship,
and will work together to secure Singapore’s cyberspace.</p>
<p><em><u>Safeguards</u></em>
</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sir, let me now move on to the third consideration, that is, what safeguards
are in place to prevent abuse? The Bill seeks to strengthen CSA’s regulatory
powers, but as some Members have pointed out, it is also important that
CSA exercises its powers responsibly.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Safeguards have been built into the Act from the outset, and will be extended
to cover the proposed amendments.</p>
<p>a. First, any entity that receives a designation notice can appeal against
it. A regulated entity may also appeal against CSA’s decisions, orders
and directions as well as codes of practice and standards of performance.
This appeal mechanism was created in the 2018 Act to protect regulated
CII owners, and will be extended to cover providers of essential services
under Part 3A, STCC owners, ESCI and major FDI providers as well.</p>
<p>b. Second, the powers that the Bill seeks to confer on CSA are not unfettered.
For example, the power of inspection provided for in the amended Section
15(4)(d) inserted by Clause 13, can only be used for the specified purpose
and under the specified circumstances set out in the provision.</p>
<p>c. Third, Section 43 of the 2018 Act, which we are retaining, requires
specified persons to preserve the secrecy of stipulated matters that come
to these persons’ knowledge in the discharge of their statutory duties.
This includes information relating to business, commercial or official
affairs of any person and identities of informants. Section 43 will continue
to govern any such information that CSA obtains through the exercise of
existing and new powers provided for by the amendments.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ms Tin Pei Ling, Mr Gerald Giam and Mr Sharael Taha and noted that the
Bill will significantly expand the scope of the Act, and asked if CSA will
be sufficiently equipped to manage this expanded ambit. If the Bill is
passed, the Government will ensure that CSA is resourced accordingly. CSA
will also continue to develop the personnel and their expertise so that
it can continue to deliver its mission at a high level.</p>
<p><strong><u>Conclusion</u></strong>
</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I hope that I have sufficiently addressed the queries raised in this House.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mr Speaker, cybersecurity is ultimately about risk management. The only
way we can absolutely guarantee cybersecurity is to not use digital technology
at all. So the task at hand is to find the appropriate balance between
security, usability, and cost. The Bill is the sum of the Government’s
proposal to address this trilemma for the most important systems that affect
the national interest. It does involve trade-offs.</p>
<p>a. Where national interests are stake, the Government needs to proactively
ensure that security considerations are optimised. Those responsible for
our CII, STCCs, and FDI services, as well as our ESCIs will have to bear
some compliance costs, but this is what it takes to keep Singapore and
Singaporeans safe and secure in the digital domain.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let me emphasise that these proposed new laws do not extend to the wider
business community. That is not to say that their cybersecurity is not
important. As Mr Mark Lee had noted in his speech, confidential business
information that our companies and organisations hold are also important
and potentially sensitive in their own context. Our companies and organisations
must recognise this and take the commensurate steps to address their own
data security risks. The Government offers our support to them through
other non-regulatory means.</p>
<p>a. For example, the SG Cyber Safe Programme. These are schemes to help
the Singapore business community be more cyber secure. This includes the
Cyber Essentials and Cyber Trust marks, which are certification schemes
that recognise enterprises that have implemented good cybersecurity practices.
CSA has also developed cybersecurity informational toolkits for companies
of various profiles to guide enterprise leaders and their employees on
cybersecurity best practices. Additionally, enterprises getting started
on cybersecurity can use the Cybersecurity Health Plans programme, where
consultants help them improve their cyber resilience, and help to develop
a plan tailored to their needs. I urge all enterprises to apply for the
various schemes and marks and take advantage of the resources available
to uplift their cybersecurity posture.</p>
<p>b. I also thank Ms Jean See, Mr Neil Parekh, Ms Razwana Begum and Mr Mark
Lee for their suggestions of other non-regulatory initiatives that the
Government could consider, particularly on shifting the mindset of stakeholders
from one of compliance to one of partnership. CSA will study these suggestions.</p>
<p>32. CSA has had a good track record in administering the Cybersecurity
Act over the past six years. CSA works closely with the regulated entities
to address their needs and concerns, and to date, no appeals have been
made against CSA’s decisions, orders or directions. This is in large part
due to the good work of our CSA officers. We have been able to attract
and retain officers with a high degree of expertise, professionalism and
integrity, who are able to balance between the considerations of security,
useability and cost, and who understand and believe in the mission of securing
Singapore’s cyberspace.</p>
<p>33. Cybersecurity is a team effort. We must continually improve our defences
against cyber threats that are growing in scale and sophistication. Today,
the Government proposes to strengthen our legislation so that we can ensure
the cybersecurity of systems and entities that are important to Singapore’s
national interests. I thank Members for their support of this Bill. Mr
Speaker, I beg to move.</p>
