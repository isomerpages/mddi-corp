<h3>Parliament Sitting on 7 January 2025</h3>
<h3>QUESTION FOR WRITTEN ANSWER</h3>
<p><strong>37. Mr Mohd Fahmi Bin Aliman </strong>asked the Minister for Digital
Development and&nbsp;Information (a) what steps is the Ministry taking
to improve digital literacy among&nbsp;elderly citizens to reduce feelings
of isolation; (b) whether the Ministry has assessed the&nbsp;success of
existing digital literacy programmes, and what metrics are used to measure&nbsp;their
impact on elderly well-being and connectivity; and (c) what policies or
programmes&nbsp;are in place to facilitate in-person social connections
for elderly residents who may not be&nbsp;able to engage digitally.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
</p>
<p>The Government supports seniors to age actively, stay socially&nbsp;connected,
and be cared for within their communities through Age Well SG. For&nbsp;example,
the Silver Generation Office conducts outreach to all seniors aged 60 and
above&nbsp;to identify their needs and refers them to relevant support
or services. This includes&nbsp;Active Ageing Centres where seniors can
participate in active ageing programmes and&nbsp; receive buddying and
befriending services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meaningful engagement with technology is one of the ways that can help
to improve&nbsp; social connectivity. A study by the DUKE-NUS Centre for
Ageing Research and&nbsp;Education found that the regular use of digital
technology among local seniors is&nbsp;associated with a lower likelihood
of being at-risk of social isolation<sup>1</sup>.</p>
<p>In this regard, Singapore has made good progress in helping seniors participate
in an&nbsp; increasingly digital environment and levelling up digital literacy.
This is achieved&nbsp;through efforts led by the Infocomm and Media Development
Authority (IMDA).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Mobile Access for Seniors scheme was launched in 2020 to support lower
income seniors with subsidised smartphone and mobile plans. More than 13,000
lower income seniors<sup>2 </sup>have benefited from the scheme.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The SG Digital Office (SDO) and the Seniors Go Digital programme were&nbsp;established
in 2020 to accelerate efforts to equip less digitally savvy individuals,&nbsp;including
seniors, with basic digital tools and skills for daily living.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building on this, the Digital Skills for Life framework was launched in
January 2024&nbsp;as a nationwide effort to equip Singaporeans with essential
digital competencies,&nbsp;including the use of smartphones to communicate,
transact and find information online,&nbsp;as well as how to stay safe
while connecting with others online.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SDO also collaborates with different partners to organise learning journeys
and&nbsp;workshops for seniors. Seniors may join digital interest groups,
known as Digital for&nbsp;Life: Digital Clubs to learn digital skills alongside
their peers at Community Clubs and&nbsp;community spaces.&nbsp;</p>
<p>More than 340,000 seniors<sup>3 </sup>have been trained through these
initiatives. Based on IMDAâ€™s Annual Survey on Infocomm Usage by Individuals,
96 per cent of&nbsp;seniors are communicating online in 2023, up from 87
per cent in 2017, suggesting&nbsp;improvements in connectivity with seniors
using technology to connect with one another&nbsp;online since the COVID-19
pandemic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through the IMDA, the Government will continue its efforts to strengthen
digital&nbsp;literacy among seniors, to help them age actively and remain
socially connected.</p>
