<h3>Parliament Sitting on 2 April 2024</h3>
<h3>QUESTION FOR WRITTEN ANSWER</h3>
<p><strong>41. Ms Hazel Poa:</strong> To ask the Minister for Communications
and Information (a) for how long will the livestreams of parliamentary
sittings be retained on MCI’s YouTube channel; and (b) whether MCI will
consider permanently retaining all livestreams of parliamentary sittings
on its YouTube channel and, if not, where will they be archived.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
</p>
<p>1. As mentioned in MCI’s reply to a similar PQ in January 2021, the full
video of each Parliamentary Sitting livestream will remain on MCI’s YouTube
channel for six months after the end of the Sitting.</p>
<p>2. The key purpose of livestreaming the Parliamentary proceedings is to
allow members of the public to view the Parliamentary proceedings real-time,
without the need to be physically present in Parliament. Thereafter, the
full records of Parliamentary proceedings are documented through the Hansard
and accessible to all online.</p>
