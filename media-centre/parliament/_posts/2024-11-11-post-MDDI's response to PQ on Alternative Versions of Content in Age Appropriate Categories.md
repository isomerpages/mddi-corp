<h3>Parliament Sitting on 11 November 2024</h3>
<h3>QUESTION FOR WRITTEN ANSWER</h3>
<p><strong>24. Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim</strong> asked the Minister for
Digital Development and Information (a) whether the Censorship Review Committee
(CRC) can consider looking into online media streaming platforms such as
Netflix, Disney+ and Amazon Prime and seek their consideration to provide
alternative versions of certain content but in age-appropriate categories;
and (b) whether CRC will endorse these platforms where they provide certain
content in different versions according to age-appropriate categories.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
</p>
<p>The Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) adopts a co-regulatory
approach with online streaming content providers such as Netflix, Disney+
and Amazon Prime. Such service providers are required to adhere to IMDA’s
Content Code for Over-the-Top, Video-On-Demand and Niche Services, including
fulfilling the necessary access control requirements to protect the young
from unsuitable content. These requirements include rating all content
on their services and presenting the rating prominently, and providing
parental locks for content rated NC16 or higher. The selection of content
offered on these platforms are commercial decisions, but are expected to
meet the above requirements. Where breaches are reported, IMDA will engage
the platforms to rectify.</p>
<p>There are currently no plans to convene a Censorship Review Committee.
The Government takes into consideration Singapore’s prevailing media and
social landscape in deciding if and when to convene content regulatory
reviews, and the appropriate format for such reviews. On content, policies
and standards that are specific to different media platforms, the IMDA
continues to consult a range of advisory committees. These varied approaches
provide greater flexibility and timeliness in responding to shifts in the
media landscape, community sentiments and societal norms.</p>
