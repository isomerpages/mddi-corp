### Parliament Sitting on 4 October 2021

QUESTION FOR WRITTEN ANSWER
---------------------------

  
**38\. Mr Don Wee:** To ask the Minister for Communications and Information (a) what has been the take-up rate of IMDA's pre-approved cybersecurity solutions among small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs); and (b) how is the Ministry increasing awareness of the importance of cybersecurity among SMEs.  
  
**Answer:**

1. Under the SMEs Go Digital programme, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) can tap on cybersecurity solutions pre-approved by the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) and the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA). Since the programme was launched in 2017, more than 5,000 SMEs have benefitted from these cybersecurity solutions that provide endpoint protection, managed detection and response, and unified threat management.   
  
2. CSA also undertakes complementary efforts to raise the cybersecurity posture of enterprises in Singapore. Under the SG Cyber Safe Programme, CSA develops cybersecurity toolkits to support enterprises with the appropriate measures and hygiene practices that they should put in place. These enterprise toolkits have been customised for different target groups, including SME owners and employees, and will be launched later this month. CSA is also developing a SG Cyber Safe Trustmark which, when launched, will help customers and partners identify enterprises with good cybersecurity measures. We encourage all enterprises to take advantage of these initiatives to safeguard themselves in cyberspace.
