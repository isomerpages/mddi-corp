<h3>Parliament Sitting on 6 February 2024</h3>
<h3>QUESTION FOR WRITTEN ANSWER</h3>
<p><strong>33. Ms See Jinli Jean: </strong>To ask the Minister for Communications
and Information with regard to the proposed Model AI Governance Framework
for Generative AI, whether the Ministry will consider (i) introducing a
licensing model which balances the needs of AI developers who require access
to training data and the owners or right holders of such data who should
be fairly compensated for the use of their works and (ii) extending consultations
on the draft framework beyond technology firms to workers and consumer
groups across industries.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Mr Speaker, NMP Ms See had deferred a related question on AI governance,
scheduled for the sitting on or after 1 March 2024. The Honourable Member
may thus wish to withdraw or amend the PQ.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As outlined in the refreshed National Artificial Intelligence Strategy
(NAIS 2.0), Singapore is fostering a trusted environment for AI, so that
our businesses and people can develop and use AI confidently.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We have been consultative in our approaches, including when we released
the 2019 Model AI Governance Framework and the open-sourcing of our testing
framework and software toolkit AI Verify in 2023. We welcome all stakeholders,
including consumer groups and our tripartite partners – workers and employers
– to provide input to our AI governance initiatives.&nbsp;

<p>Most recently:</p>

</ol>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <strong>ASEAN Guide on AI Governance and Ethics</strong> was
endorsed at the 4th ASEAN Digital Ministers’ Meeting in Singapore last
week, following consultations with a wide range of stakeholders (<em>including ASEAN Dialogue Partners (China, Japan and the US), Development Partners like the International Telecommunications Union, and industry players across ASEAN</em>).&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We also announced the proposed <strong>“Model AI Governance Framework for Generative AI” </strong>at
the World Economic Forum in January to seek views internationally. The
draft Framework is currently open for public feedback until 15 March 2024.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<ol start="5" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>As we have explained in past Sittings, AI is an evolving and fast-changing
technology. Both its uses and users are also constantly growing and evolving.
While there is broad consensus on the importance of trustworthy and responsible
AI globally, governance approaches are still nascent. Singapore will continue
to monitor these developments and review our governance frameworks and
regulations to ensure that they remain fit-for-purpose. We will continue
to be consultative in our approach, and welcome views of all stakeholders,
including our tripartite partners.</p>
