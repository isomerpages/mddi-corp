### Parliament Sitting on 5 October 2020 

QUESTION FOR WRITTEN ANSWER
---------------------------

**45. Mr Muhamad Faisal Abdul Manap:** To ask the Minister for Communications and Information (a) to date, how many low-income households have benefited from the Home Access 3.0 programme for minimum broadband speeds; and (b) whether higher minimum broadband speeds can be considered for the Home Access programme to cater for the growing need for online access.   
  
**Answer:**  
  
1. The Home Access 3.0 programme was launched in April 2020 and has supported close to 1,500 beneficiaries to date.   
  
2. The speed of broadband provided under Home Access has improved over the years, in response to consumer needs.  Earlier this year, the minimum broadband speed offered was raised from 300Mbps to 500Mbps, with no increase in the monthly co-payment for beneficiaries that opt for a broadband-only plan. This is higher than the minimum speed available on the market, and is sufficient to support common daily activities such as internet surfing, video calls, and video streaming. More than 80% of beneficiaries have opted for the minimum broadband speed of 500Mbbps. Home Access also offers a 1Gbps option for households that prefer higher speed broadband.  
  
3. We will continue to review the Home Access scheme regularly, to ensure that its offerings keep pace with the needs of citizens.
