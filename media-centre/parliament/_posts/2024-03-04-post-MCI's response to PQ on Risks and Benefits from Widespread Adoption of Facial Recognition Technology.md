<h3>Parliament Sitting on 4 March 2024</h3>
<h3>QUESTION FOR WRITTEN ANSWER</h3>
<p><strong>13. Mr Yip Hon Weng: </strong>To ask the Minister for Communications
and Information (a) what are the risks and benefits associated with widespread
adoption of facial recognition technology (FRT) in Singapore; (b) what
are the frameworks and oversight mechanisms currently in place to ensure
the responsible and ethical use of FRT in Singapore; and (c) what steps
are being taken to engage with the public and relevant stakeholders about
the responsible development and application of AI technologies to FRT.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
</p>
<p>1. Facial images as a form of biometric data can be considered personal
data when associated with other information about an individual. When private
sector organisations in Singapore collect and use such data, including
for identification through Facial Recognition Technologies (FRT), they
must comply with the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA).</p>
<p>2. In Singapore, a key use of facial biometric data and FRTs is for security
purposes. In 2022, the Personal Data Protection Commission (PDPC) and the
Security Association Singapore jointly published a Guide on the Responsible
Use of Biometric Data in Security Applications, to guide organisations
on the key considerations and safeguards for using biometric data responsibly
and ethically. IMDA and PDPCâ€™s Model AI Governance Framework (2020) also
provides general guidance in addressing key ethical and governance issues
when deploying AI solutions, which can be relevant for FRTs.</p>
