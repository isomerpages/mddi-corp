QUESTION FOR WRITTEN ANSWER
---------------------------

**34\. Ms He Ting Ru:** To ask the Minister for Communications and Information (a) whether the Ministry undertakes customer satisfaction surveys to assess SingPost's performance as part of its quality of service framework; and (b) if so, what are the findings of the surveys for the last three years.

**Answer:**

1. The Infocomm Media Development Authority (or IMDA) conducts periodic consumer surveys to gain a better understanding on the usage trends of, and satisfaction with, postal services in Singapore. 

2. In IMDA’s 2020 survey, 88% of respondents indicated that they were satisfied with the service quality for delivery of letters.
  
3. In addition to IMDA’s surveys, SingPost also carries out its own customer satisfaction surveys at post offices and through its MyPostman programme. SingPost’s 2022 surveys showed an average score of around 4 out of 5 for its post office and postman services.   
  
4. IMDA also regularly monitors SingPost’s compliance with the Quality of Service (QoS) standards through quarterly independent assessments. Through these measures, IMDA will continue to safeguard consumer interest, and ensure that SingPost continues to provide a reliable and good quality postal service.
