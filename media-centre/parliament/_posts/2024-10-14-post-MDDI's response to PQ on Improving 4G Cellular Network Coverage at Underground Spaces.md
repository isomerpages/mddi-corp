<h3>Parliament Sitting on 14 October 2024</h3>
<h3>QUESTION FOR ORAL ANSWER</h3>
<p><strong>*62. Ms See Jinli Jean </strong>asked the Minister for Digital
Development and Information (a) whether the measure of more than 85% per
building of in-building service coverage for the 4G cellular network required
of mobile operators under IMDA’s 4G Quality of Service framework covers
below ground parking spaces of buildings; (b) what is the extent of service
coverage in such spaces; and (c) what are the plans to ensure that the
in-building service network coverage extends to such spaces, in view that
many buildings situate their delivery bays at building basements.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
</p>
<p>Mobile operators are required by Infocomm Media Development Authority
to provide coverage of at least 85% within buildings, including first-level
basement carparks. If mobile operators’ overall coverage for a building
falls below 85%, they are required to take action to improve.</p>
<p>Within a building, mobile operators can decide whether to provide coverage
in specific areas like lifts, equipment rooms, and carparks located at
second-level basements or below. Footfall in these areas tends to be transient,
and it is up to building owners to assess if they require mobile service
coverage. They may engage mobile operators to do so on a commercial basis.</p>
