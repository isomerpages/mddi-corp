adequate redundancy and backups amidst increasing cyber threats.</p>
<p><strong>*6753. Mr Yip Hon Weng </strong>asked the Minister for Digital

robust redundancies and backup systems are in place to minimise the impact
on critical essential services from such disruptions; (b) what caused the
fault and whether penalties will be imposed on Singtel; and (c) whether
there will be an independent inquiry to identify vulnerabilities and prevent
future incidents.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
</p>
<p>Mr Speaker, may I have your permission to answer PQs 11 through to 16
on today’s Order Paper, as well as Written Question No 23 on today’s Order
Paper, filed by MP Ms See Jinli, together as they relate to the same incident.</p>
<p>Sir, on the 8<sup>th</sup> of October 2024, Singtel’s fixed line voice
service faced intermittent service disruption. This affected some residential
and corporate users, including Government emergency phone lines such as
SCDF’s 995 and SPF’s 999 lines, and customer service lines for some government
agencies, healthcare organisations, and companies. MHA and MOH will be
responding to queries on the service impact on their respective sectors
arising from the incident. During the disruption, it is estimated that
half of the calls could still be connected. All services were progressively
restored over a 4-hour time period from the start of the incident.</p>
<p>IMDA, the Infocomm Media Development Authority, takes a serious view of
this incident and is investigating the cause of this disruption and whether
Singtel’s incident response was adequate. Preliminary findings suggest
that there was a technical issue which affected the proper functioning
of a network component in one of the two systems supporting Singtel’s fixed
line voice service. The two systems, located in separate telephone exchanges,
are designed to immediately take over the full load of the other system
when one system malfunctions. However, in this instance, the failover did
not happen seamlessly, which caused the intermittent service disruption.
There is no evidence to suggest that the incident was related to a sabotage
or cyber-attack. IMDA is continuing its investigations.</p>
<p>The telecommunication network in Singapore is a key infrastructure that
supports our nation’s connectivity needs and requirements. IMDA holds key
service providers, like Singtel, to high service standards and requires
them to conduct regular audits on their network and infrastructure. This
includes ensuring the security of network design, redundancy measures,
and business continuity plans. Service providers must also ensure that
their networks are resilient against disruptions. IMDA will not hesitate
to take strong action under the Telecommunication Act, including imposing
financial penalties, should any lapses be identified. IMDA is working with
MHA, SCDF and SPF to conduct a comprehensive review on the availability
of our emergency hotlines when disruptions occur.</p>
