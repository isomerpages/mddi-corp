<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
</p>
<p>On 19 July 2024, a faulty software update by a cybersecurity service provider
CrowdStrike disrupted major services around the world. Images of the now
infamous Blue Screen of Death appeared in media news cycles and attracted
significant public attention. According to public reports, outages were
experienced by users of the Microsoft Windows operating system that adopted
CrowdStrike’s Falcon Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solution. It
is a security solution that requires frequent and timely updates to be
effective.</p>
<p>The Members’ questions fall broadly into two categories. First, what is
the impact of the outage in Singapore, particularly in relation to services
provided by Government. Second, what are the lessons learnt, particularly
in relation to the resilience of our IT systems.</p>
<p>Fortuitously, Government services and most essential services in Singapore
were unaffected by the outages. However, some businesses that use CrowdStrike’s
Falcon EDR were affected. In most cases, the impact was to internal staff.
In a minority of the cases, customers were impacted due to service disruptions.
Prominent examples of these were the passenger check-in for some airlines
at Changi Terminal 4 and gantry operations at some HDB carparks.</p>
<p>Customers of affected business met with delays and were inconvenienced.
However, Business Continuity Plans (BCPs) kicked in. These included switching
over to manual processes, such as for flight ticketing and check-in. The
Singapore Cyber Emergency Response Team (SingCERT) of the Cyber Security
Agency of Singapore (CSA) also quickly issued an advisory to guide affected
system administrators and users on how to manually recover their systems.
Most of the affected IT systems had recovered within a day, and services
returned to normal.</p>
<p>As Members know, IT systems may experience outages and disruptions from
time to time. In this particular instance, it is not yet fully understood
what caused a relatively routine software update to have created such major
disruptions around the world. My ministry has set up an internal taskforce
to engage relevant partners to gain insights into the incident and assess
if further measures should be taken to improve Singapore’s resilience when
such disruptions occur.</p>
<p>In the meantime, one key lesson can already be reinforced. As we have
said on previous occasions, even with best efforts, not all disruptions
can be prevented. System owners should therefore have plans in place to
help them to recover quickly from unexpected disturbances.</p>
<p>On its part, the Government adopts a risk-based approach to ensure our
critical systems and essential services are resilient. Critical Information
Infrastructures (CIIs), Essential Services (ES) and Government services
are all subject to stringent requirements and have to put in place robust
BCPs, Disaster Recovery Plans (DRPs), and Incident Response Plans (IRPs).
The Cybersecurity Act (CS Act) and specific sectoral regulations hold CIIs
and key ES operators accountable for meeting the baseline security and
resilience requirements. This includes timely review of risks assessments
and audits. For example, Government agencies using third-party software
in their ICT systems have to do a thorough risk assessment and put in place
necessary mitigation measures. CSA also established the CII Supply Chain
Programme to better manage key vendor supply chain risks.</p>
<p>Businesses must also play their part to improve their resilience when
disruptions occur and recognise that it is in their own, and their customers’
interests to do so. When things are running smoothly, businesses may question
why they should incur cost or prioritise efforts to assess and improve
their resilience measures. Unfortunately, some may not take appropriate
actions until it is too late.</p>
<p>We therefore encourage businesses to conduct their own risk assessments
and put in place the appropriate BCPs to help business continuity in the
event of a disruption. SingCERT has recently published an advisory on building
digital resiliency, which can be found on CSA’s website. As part of the
support for enterprises’ digitalisation, my ministry offers other practical
resources and financial assistance to encourage robust IT practices. This
includes CSA’s cybersecurity toolkits and IMDA’s SMEs Go Digital Programme.</p>
<p>While these efforts may not specifically address IT outages like the one
related to CrowdStrike, they can help businesses prevent incidents and
recover more quickly should disruptions occur. I also encourage all businesses
to take advantage of the Government’s resource support to strengthen their
digital resilience.</p>
