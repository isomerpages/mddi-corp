<h3>Parliament Sitting on 15 October 2024</h3>
<h3>QUESTION FOR WRITTEN ANSWER</h3>
<p><strong>13. Ms Hazel Poa</strong> asked the Minister for Digital Development
and Information what criteria are used by the Government to determine whether
or not to issue correction directions under Protection from Online Falsehoods
and Manipulation Act when factual errors are published.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
</p>
<p>Ministers are empowered to issue Correction Directions under the Protection
from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act 2019 (POFMA). Two conditions
must be satisfied before a Correction Direction can be issued; first, a
false statement of fact must be communicated in Singapore, and second,
the Minister in question is of the opinion that it is in the public interest
to issue the Correction Direction.</p>
<p>Whether a Correction Direction should be issued for a false statement
of fact is a fact specific assessment made by the Minister within whose
domain the falsehood falls. The relevant Minister, supported by his or
her staff with the requisite domain expertise, will carefully evaluate
each case. This includes the nature of the falsehood, its context and the
harm to the public, before deciding whether a Correction Direction should
be issued.</p>
