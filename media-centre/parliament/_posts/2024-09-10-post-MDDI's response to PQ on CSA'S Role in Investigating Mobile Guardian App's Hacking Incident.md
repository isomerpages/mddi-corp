<h3>Parliament Sitting on 10 September 2024</h3>
<h3>QUESTION FOR ORAL ANSWER</h3>
<p><strong>*71. Ms Hazel Poa </strong>asked the Minister for Digital Development
and Information (a) whether the Cyber Security Agency (CSA) is assisting
the Ministry in investigating the Mobile Guardian hacking incident in August
2024; (b) what is CSA’s role in assisting other agencies in investigating
security vulnerabilities in IT systems owned, operated, or otherwise used
by the Government; and (c) whether the task force set up to bolster Singapore’s
tech resilience following the CrowdStrike outage will also be assessing
the Mobile Guardian incident in August 2024.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
</p>
<p>The Cyber Security Agency (CSA) focuses on the higher risk systems that
could affect our national security and delivery of essential services because
of the widespread or systemic impact if disrupted. These are designated
as Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) under the Cybersecurity Act,
and held to high standards of cybersecurity and resilience. CSA also requires
CII owners to conduct regular audits and testing on their CIIs so that
vulnerabilities can be quickly identified and remediated. If they encounter
cyber-attacks, CSA’s incident response teams will support CII owners to
investigate, contain and remediate the attack.</p>
<p>But not all government information technology (IT) systems are designated
as CIIs, nor should they be. Disruptions to non-CII IT systems cause varying
degrees of impact. It is therefore only practical to take a risk-based
approach in managing their cybersecurity and resilience. Their disruption
may cause inconvenience and loss which should certainly be avoided. But,
the consequences are generally localised or do not pose widespread or systemic
disruptions compared to disruption to a CII. The owners of these non-CII
systems, are in the best position to decide the resources to be put in
to protect such systems against disruption, which should in general, be
proportionate to their risks and impact. All systems must, however, maintain
a baseline of cybersecurity and resilience measures that are appropriately
stepped up according to their risk assessments. Defensive measures must
also be complemented by business continuity plans that mitigate the impact
of disruptions when they occur. Agencies that own IT systems are responsible
for their cybersecurity and resilience. They can draw on the expertise
of CSA and Government Technology Agency (GovTech), if needed, to investigate
vulnerabilities and compromises that have been discovered.</p>
<p>A device management solution such as that provided by Mobile Guardian
is not a CII. While the Ministry of Education has overall responsibility
for its cybersecurity and resilience, CSA and GovTech provided various
types of support such as forensic investigations when incidents happened.
The Minister of Education has already covered the details in his earlier
reply.</p>
<p>My Ministry has set up the Task Force to draw lessons from the CrowdStrike
incident as the incident had the potential to cause disruptions to a wider
set of systems. This is part of the effort to strengthen the overall security
and resilience of our digital infrastructure.</p>
