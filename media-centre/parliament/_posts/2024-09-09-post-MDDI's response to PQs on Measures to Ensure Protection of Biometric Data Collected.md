<h3>QUESTION FOR ORAL ANSWER</h3>

data by private entities is or will be regulated.</p>
<p><strong>*39. Mr Mark Lee </strong>asked the Minister for Digital Development
and Information (a) how is the Government addressing the risks of scams
and fraudulent activities that can result from the misuse of biometric
data by private entities; (b) what regulatory frameworks are in place or
being considered to oversee and monitor the activities of such entities
to ensure compliance with data protection laws and standards; and (c) what
steps are being taken to educate the public about the potential risks of
sharing their biometric data with these entities.</p>
<p><strong>*40. Mr Mark Lee </strong>asked the Minister for Digital Development
and Information how is the Government collaborating with international
counterparts to ensure a cohesive and robust approach to managing and mitigating
the risks associated with biometric data collection technologies by private
entities.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
</p>
<p>My response will also cover the matter raised in the question for oral
answer by Mr Zhulkarnain which is scheduled for a subsequent sitting. I
invite the Member to seek clarifications, if need be. If the question has
been addressed, it may not be necessary for him to proceed with the question
for future sittings.</p>
<p>The Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) governs the collection, use, disclosure
and care of personal data by organisations in Singapore, including Worldcoin.
Biometric data – which relate to the physiological, biological or behavioral
characteristics of an individual – can form part of the personal data of
an individual. The Personal Data Protection Commission (PDPC) has also
issued a Guide on Responsible Use of Biometric Data in Security Applications,
to advise on risks unique to biometric recognition technology and measures
to govern and protect biometric data.</p>
<p>As biometric data are generally unique, they cannot be changed once compromised,
unlike passwords or other tokens. Stolen biometric data can therefore be
misused by malicious actors to spoof an individual’s identity – in order
to access information or systems or conduct scams or other fraudulent activity.
Such misuse is harder to defuse because biometric data cannot be changed.</p>
<p>Organisations that handle such data must ensure they put in place the
necessary data protection and security arrangements to address these risks,
when designing and operating their systems and processes. They must also
obtain consent from consumers before collecting their data by giving all
necessary information in a manner that is understandable to the consumer.</p>
<p>The PDPC has been engaging Worldcoin on their obligations under the PDPA
and will continue to monitor their collection, use and disclosure of personal
data, including biometric data. The PDPC may take enforcement action against
organisations in Singapore that are found to have breached their obligations
under the PDPA. The PDPC also monitors developments in other jurisdictions
and is ready to work with international counterparts as necessary.</p>
<p>To support the adoption of good data protection practices, the PDPC conducts
educational and outreach activities through events such as the annual Personal
Data Protection Week and Privacy Awareness Week. The PDPC has also worked
with MOM to disseminate notices to migrant workers to raise awareness about
the importance of keeping their personal data safe.</p>
<p>Ultimately, everyone must exercise judgement and ensure they fully understand
how their personal data will be used by whom before giving consent for
it to be collected.</p>
