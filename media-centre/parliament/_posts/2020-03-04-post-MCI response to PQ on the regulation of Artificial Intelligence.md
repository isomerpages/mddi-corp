### Parliament Sitting on 4 March 2020

QUESTION FOR WRITTEN ANSWER
---------------------------

  
**4\. Mr Leon Perera:** To ask the Minister for Communications and Information whether the Government is considering formulating regulations binding on artificial intelligence (AI) systems deployed locally so as to ensure the ethical and safe use of AI.  
  
**Answer:**  
  
1. As AI technology is still nascent, MCI does not have immediate plans to introduce new laws to regulate AI.       
  
2. However, MCI has launched several initiatives to ensure the safe and ethical use of AI, and to promote consumer trust and innovation.  These include:  
    a. A Model AI Governance Framework (“**Model Framework**”) which translates ethical AI principles into practical steps to guide organisations’ responsible adoption of AI;   
    b. An Advisory Council on the Ethical Use of AI and Data, which provides guidance to manage legal, ethical and sustainability risks; and  
    c. A Research Programme on the Governance of AI and Data Use, which examines ethical and legal issues arising from the development and use of AI.  
  
3. The Personal Data Protection Commission (“**PDPC**”) also works with sectoral regulators such as MAS on sector-specific guidance (i.e.  MAS’ Fairness, Ethics, Accountability and Transparency (“**FEAT**”) principles[^1]) that is in line with PDPC’s Model Framework.   

4. Organisations are also required to comply with relevant laws and regulations when deploying AI technology such as those pertaining to safety, data protection and fair competition.   
  
5. MCI and PDPC will continue to monitor global developments, and ensure that our regulatory approach safeguards individuals’ interests and preserves public confidence in AI, while enabling data-driven innovation to thrive in the Digital Economy.  
  
[^1]: MAS FEAT principles provide guidance to firms offering financial products and services on the responsible use of AI and data analytics.
