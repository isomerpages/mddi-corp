QUESTION FOR WRITTEN ANSWER

**20. Mr Leon Perera:** To ask the Minister for Communications and Information what impact will the US Huawei ban have on Singapore's 5G deployment.

**Answer:**

1. I have previously stated that our plan is to begin the roll out of 5G infrastructure next year.  As of now, we expect to continue as planned with the deployment of 5G in Singapore.  
  
2. Meanwhile, we are closely monitoring developments, consulting stakeholders, evaluating the technical aspects, and piloting use cases for 5G.  IMDA has been seeking the industry’s views through a public consultation which concludes tomorrow.  
  
3. These initiatives and their findings will inform our decision and help us to work with the telcos and other stakeholders to commence the roll out of a resilient and secure 5G infrastructure in a timely manner.
