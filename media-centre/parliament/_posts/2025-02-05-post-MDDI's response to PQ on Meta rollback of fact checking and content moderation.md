<h3>Parliament Sitting on 5 February 2025</h3>
<h3>QUESTION FOR ORAL ANSWER</h3>
<p><strong>*7160. Mr Alex Yam Ziming </strong>asked the Minister for Digital
Development and Information in light of the recent announcements by Meta
to eliminate fact-checking and reduce content moderation efforts (a) what
is the Ministry’s assessment of the potential impact on the spread of misinformation
and harmful content on Meta’s platforms; (b) whether there are implications
for Singapore’s digital ecosystem and the safety of online discourse; and
(c) what measures will be introduced or enhanced to promote information
integrity and responsible digital citizenship in Singapore, particularly
when global technology companies adopt more lenient moderation policies.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
</p>
<p>Social media has increasingly become the primary source of news and information
for many Singapore users online. A reliable fact-checking and content moderation
system on social media platforms therefore serves as a crucial first line
of defence against misinformation and harmful online content, allowing
platforms to act early to detect, correct, or filter out such material.</p>
<p>Meta has been assessed to be a social media platform with significant
reach in Singapore.&nbsp; The Government is naturally concerned about the
impact of its policies and practices on Singapore. We are therefore monitoring
developments arising from the company’s announcement to replace third-party
fact-checking with crowdsourced fact-checking and revise its hate speech
policies across its platforms. Based on publicly available report, these
changes will be limited to within the US, at least in the near term. Nonetheless,
we will assess their impact on Singapore, especially if the changes are
also implemented here.</p>
<p>In the meantime, we will continue our existing approach to addressing
misinformation and ensure that it remains fit-for-purpose. In terms of
regulations, the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act
(“POFMA”) enables the Government to issue corrections against online falsehoods
that are against the public interest. The Codes of Practice under POFMA
also require the prescribed internet intermediaries to put in place safeguards
to promote credible online sources of information, enhance transparency
in political advertising, and prevent and counter the abuse of online accounts.
In addition, our Code of Practice for Online Safety under the Broadcasting
Act requires designated social media services, including Meta’s platforms,
such as Facebook and Instagram, to have systems or processes to prevent
Singapore users from accessing harmful content.</p>
<p>Beyond regulations, it is also important for Singaporeans to be able to
protect themselves against risks in the online space. To this end, the
Government has put in place public education programmes to equip Singaporeans
with the skills to critically evaluate information and protect themselves
against misinformation. As an example, the National Library Board’s S.U.R.E
(Source, Understand, Research, and Evaluate) programme has developed resources
and organised activities to equip Singaporeans to be discerning producers
and consumers of information. As part of the Digital for Life movement
and the Digital Skills for Life framework, IMDA has also developed resources
to equip Singaporeans to be safe, smart, and kind online, including skills
on identifying and taking action against false information.</p>
<p>We are also keeping up with efforts to leverage technology to respond
to online harms. In May last year, we committed $50 million in funding
over five years to the Centre for Advanced Technologies in Online Safety
(CATOS), which will bring together government, industry, academics, and
civil society, to develop and deploy technological solutions to build a
safer online ecosystem for Singapore users. Part of CATOS’ work includes
testing “Trust by Design” technologies, such as watermarking and content
authentication, so as to enhance the authenticity of digital content.</p>
<p>The Government will continue to review our range of online safety efforts,
to keep pace with a fast-changing social media landscape and ensure Singaporeans
can continue to access safe and trusted online spaces.</p>
