### Parliament Sitting on 10 January 2023

QUESTION FOR WRITTEN ANSWER
---------------------------

**18. Mr Leong Mun Wa**i: To ask the Minister for Communications and Information whether the Government or any other entities owned or controlled by the Government provides funding to any foreign persons providing public commentary to promote or support Government policies or Singapore on social media platforms such as Facebook.

**Answer: **

1. The Ministry of Communications and Information does not track the amount spent by the Government on paid advertising based on nationality.   

2. Except for the Singapore Tourism Board in promoting Singapore as a tourism destination, it is not part of our communications and engagement strategy to pay foreign individuals to publish commentaries in support of Government policies or Singapore, on social media or anywhere else.
