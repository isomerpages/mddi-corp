<h3>Parliament Sitting on 4 March 2025</h3>
<h3>QUESTION FOR WRITTEN ANSWER</h3>
<p><strong>6. Mr Yip Hon Weng </strong>asked the Minister for Digital Development
and Information (a) whether the Ministry can provide insights into the
impact of prolonged exposure caused by delayed removal of harmful contents
by social media platforms on the well- being of children; and (b) what
targeted measures are being considered to ensure social media platforms
prioritise the timely removal of contents that pose significant risks to
vulnerable users.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
</p>
<p>The Government seeks to protect vulnerable users, especially children,
from harmful and age-inappropriate content on social media services. The
Infocomm Media Development Authority’s (IMDA’s) Code of Practice for Online
Safety requires social media services with significant reach or impact
to put in place online safety measures, including differentiated measures
for young users.</p>
<p>Six Designated Social Media Services (DSMSs) were assessed recently for
the comprehensiveness and effectiveness of these measures. X and HardwareZone
were found to have shortcomings in user safety measures for children. For
example, the services’ own community guidelines for children were frequently
breached, resulting in children being more exposed to age-inappropriate
content than was desirable. Even for DSMSs that did better in this area
such as Facebook and YouTube, children could still access some age-inappropriate
content.</p>
<p>Other than user safety features, the DSMSs should improve on the effectiveness
and timeliness of their response to user reports. More often than not,
content that violated the services’ community guidelines were not removed
even after users reported their presence. Most DSMSs also took an average
of five days or more to act on these user reports.</p>
<p>These findings show that DSMSs need to step up efforts to protect users
on their platforms. IMDA has engaged the DSMSs to do so and will review
their responses when their next annual online safety reports are due in
June 2025. In addition, IMDA is studying how social media services should
use age assurance technology to better protect children and youth from
age-inappropriate content. As to the impact of prolonged exposure, the
Ministry of Digital Development and Information does not have authoritative
findings to share. Nonetheless, we will continue to monitor DSMSs’ efforts
to enhance online safety.</p>
