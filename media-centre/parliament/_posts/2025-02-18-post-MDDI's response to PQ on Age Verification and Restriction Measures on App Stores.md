<h3>Parliament Sitting on 18 February 2025</h3>
<h3>QUESTION FOR ORAL ANSWER</h3>
<p><strong>*20. Mr Yip Hon Weng </strong>asked the Minister for Digital Development
and Information (a) how does the Ministry plan to ensure the effective
implementation of age verification and restriction measures by app stores
so that only age-appropriate apps are accessible to children given that
children may download apps through their parents' user accounts; and (b)
whether the Ministry will consider mandating more robust age verification
methods such as facial recognition technology, to prevent children from
bypassing age restrictions using their parents' passwords or biometric
data.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
</p>
<p>The Code of Practice for Online Safety for App Distribution Services published
by the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) will take effect on
31 March 2025. It aims to reduce the risk of exposure to harmful content
for users, especially young users, on apps.</p>
<p>To achieve its objective, the Code requires designated app stores to put
in place age assurance measures to prevent young users from accessing age-inappropriate
apps. Age estimation through the use of facial estimation technology is
one of the measures which designated app stores can choose to implement
to meet the requirements. However, the Code does not prescribe specific
methods or technologies. The designated app stores can decide what works
best for them, as long as the online safety outcomes are met.</p>
<p>IMDA will continue to engage these app stores over the next few months
on their implementation plans. For a start, they are minimally expected
to be able to ascertain users under 18 and prevent them from accessing
their highest age-rated apps (e.g. 18+). IMDA will assess if the plans
meet the requirements under the Code.</p>
<p>Regulations alone are unlikely to prevent a parent or any adult from helping
a child circumvent the age assurance measures. It is also important to
educate parents on their important role in keeping children safe online.
To this end, the Government has put in place public education efforts to
equip parents with the knowledge and skills to guide their children’s digital
journey and safeguard them against risks online. As an example, the Ministry
of Education (MOE), Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) and
Health Promotion Board (HPB) launched the Parenting for Wellness initiative
in September 2024, which covers resources on various topics such as managing
screen use and addressing cyberbullying. Parents can also visit the IMDA’s
Digital for Life portal for bite-sized strategies on safe and responsible
use of digital technologies.</p>
<p>We will continue to work closely with the industry on the age assurance
requirements and implementation, as part of our ongoing efforts to enhance
online safety in Singapore.</p>
