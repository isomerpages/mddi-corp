<h3>Parliament Sitting on 6 March 2024</h3>
<h3>QUESTION FOR ORAL ANSWER</h3>
<p><strong>*1. Mr Yip Hon Weng: </strong>To ask the Minister for Communications
and Information given the recent security breaches of several foreign government
computer systems (a) whether the Ministry has detected similar attacks
on our Government computer systems over the past three years; and (b) how
does the Ministry respond to cyber acts by state-sponsored actors.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>There were recent reports that a Chinese cybersecurity firm, I-Soon, had
allegedly compromised nearly twenty foreign governments. Singapore was
not listed as an affected country.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Cyber Security Agency (CSA) and GovTech work with our security agencies
to monitor threats and respond to any cyberattack on our critical computer
systems. Given their sensitive nature, we are unable to publicly discuss
such operations and responses.</p>
</li>
</ol>
