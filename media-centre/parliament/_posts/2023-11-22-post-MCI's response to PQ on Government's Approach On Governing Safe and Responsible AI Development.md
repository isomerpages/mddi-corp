### Parliament Sitting on 22 November 2023

### QUESTION FOR WRITTEN ANSWER

**37. Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis:** To ask the Minister for Communications and Information (a) what is the Government’s approach and policy on governing the safe
and responsible development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Singapore; and (b) what are the subsequent steps that the Government is planning to take in AI governance following the signing of the Bletchley Declaration.

**Answer:**

1. Singapore’s approach to the responsible development and deployment of AI has been explained at the 21 April 2023, 9 May 2023, 6 July 2023, and 6 November 2023 sittings.

2. Singapore has been consistent in our support for international efforts that enhance alignment on AI governance. These provide greater certainty and clarity to
businesses and citizens, as developers and deployers of AI. Recent initiatives include the Bletchley Declaration in November 2023, and the completion of a joint
mapping exercise between IMDA’s AI Verify and the US National Institute of Standards and Technology’s AI Risk Management Framework in October 2023. We will build on these through our partnership in research and development with the UK AI Safety Institute and our bilateral AI Governance Group with the US respectively, in addition to supporting existing multilateral, multi-stakeholder efforts at the United Nations, World Economic Forum, and Global Partnership on AI.
