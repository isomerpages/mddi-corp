<h3>Parliament Sitting on 7 May 2024</h3>
<h3>QUESTION FOR WRITTEN ANSWER</h3>
<p><strong>*46. Mr Alex Yam Ziming </strong>asked the Minister for Communications
and Information with regard to a recent advertisement banner that utilised
inappropriate child imagery (a) what are the regulations relating to the
use of children’s images in advertising, including situations where images
may be artificially generated; (b) whether the Ministry is aware if the
Advertising Standards Authority of Singapore collaborates with various
organisations to ensure consistent enforcement of advertising regulations
across all platforms; and (c) whether the Ministry will review the advertising
approval processes to prevent future occurrences.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
</p>
<p>Commercial advertising in Singapore is regulated by the Advertising Standards
Authority of Singapore (ASAS) through the Singapore Code of Advertising
Practice (SCAP). The SCAP applies to all advertisements for any goods and
services appearing in any form or any media. It stipulates that all advertisements
should be legal, decent, honest and truthful.</p>
<p>The SCAP also stipulates that “special care should be taken in marketing
communication directed towards or depicting children and young people”.
This includes ensuring that the content does not contain any statement
or visual presentation that might have the effect of harming children mentally,
morally or physically.</p>
<p>Advertisements are not required to be approved by ASAS before they are
published. ASAS adopts a complaints-based approach in reviewing potential
advertising breaches when reported to them. ASAS promotes ethical advertising
through the SCAP, and can inform advertisers to amend or withdraw advertisements
that are deemed to have breached the SCAP. ASAS also periodically reviews
the SCAP to ensure it continues to address key issues in the evolving advertising
landscape. These reviews are made in consultation with relevant Government
agencies such as the Infocomm Media Development Authority, Monetary Authority
of Singapore, Health Sciences Authority, Singapore Food Agency, Gambling
Regulatory Authority as well as the advertising industry. ASAS is conducting
such a review currently.</p>
