### Parliament Sitting on 1 August 2022

QUESTION FOR WRITTEN ANSWER
------------------------------------

**68. Dr Tan Wu Meng:** asked the Minister for Communications and Information (a) whether additional safeguards or regulatory measures can be taken to prevent unsolicited messages from being sent to Singaporeans regarding unlicensed loans and illegal gambling websites; (b) to what extent such messages can be tracked to their point of origin; and (c) what are the current steps being taken to crack down on syndicates sending such unsolicited messages.

**Answer:**

1. The Singapore Police Force (SPF) will take the necessary enforcement actions when they receive complaints from members of public on messages on illegal remote gambling and unlicensed moneylending services. The SPF and the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) work with the telecommunication providers (telcos) to block messages related to unlicensed moneylenders and illegal gambling websites by terminating phone numbers linked to such activities.

2. SIM card registration requirements have also been tightened to prevent errant use of prepaid SIM cards by criminal syndicates to disseminate these messages. IMDA and SPF are also working with Internet Service Providers to block websites that promote unlicensed loans and illegal gambling. Where it is possible to track the identities of the perpetrators, SPF will take them to task.
