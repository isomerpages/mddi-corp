<h3>Parliament Sitting on 11 November 2024</h3>
<h3>QUESTION FOR ORAL ANSWER</h3>
<p><strong>*32. Dr Wan Rizal</strong> asked the Minister for Digital Development
and Information what support mechanisms are available to young users and
their families to mitigate the mental health impact on young users arising
from interactions with artificial intelligence platforms, particularly
those designed to simulate human interactions.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
</p>
<p>Research on the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) platforms on mental
health is still nascent and there is no conclusive evidence to date.</p>
<p>The Government’s approach has been to equip Singaporeans, including young
users, to use technology in a safe, healthy and balanced manner. For example:</p>
<p>Cyber Wellness and Mental Health Education lessons are taught in schools
as part of the Ministry of Education’s Character and Citizenship Education
curriculum. Through the lessons, students are taught to be safe, respectful,
and responsible online users. They also learn to take care of their mental
well-being, differentiate between stress and distress, regulate their emotions,
and seek help early. Across various subjects, students also acquire relevant
digital literacies, such as to critically evaluate communication with AI
technologies, collaborate with one another using AI, and use AI tools safely
and responsibly.</p>
<p>To equip parents to guide their children’s online interactions and support
their digital well-being, the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA)
offers bite-sized resources on the Digital for Life (DfL) portal. In addition,
programmes such as the recently concluded DfL Festival provide opportunities
for parents and children to learn about emerging technologies and how to
protect themselves against online harms.</p>
<p>The National Library Board’s S.U.R.E initiative also offers resources
on the benefits and risks of technology, including generative AI.</p>
<p>For families who suspect their child is struggling with mental health
issues arising from digital technology use, including interactions with
AI platforms, they can seek help from community service providers such
as TOUCH Community Services, which runs counselling and intervention programmes
for youths affected by cyber and mental wellness issues. Young users may
also approach Youth Community Outreach Teams (or CREST-Youth) and Youth
Integrated Teams, which provide mental health services to youths aged 12
to 25 years old.</p>
