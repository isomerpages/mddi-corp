<h3>Parliament Sitting on 6 August 2024</h3>
<h3>QUESTION FOR WRITTEN ANSWER</h3>
<p><strong>38. Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling</strong> asked the Minister for Digital
Development and Information with the gradual retirement of 3G network by
telecommunications companies in Singapore, whether active communication
and support have been provided to 3G users, particularly seniors and those
users who cannot afford to transit to 4G/5G services.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
</p>
<p>In July 2023, Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) M1, Singtel, and StarHub
announced plans to retire their 3G networks. This will unlock spectrum
capacity for future-ready 5G networks to provide users with a better mobile
experience and support enterprise digital transformation. MNOs were informed
by IMDA that they could start retiring their 3G networks from 31 July 2024,
provided they ensure the smooth migration of remaining 3G subscribers to
4G or 5G networks.</p>
<p>IMDA has closely monitored the MNOs’ progress. Over the past year, the
MNOs have actively reached out to their 3G subscribers to raise awareness
of the 3G network retirement and their plans to assist subscribers in the
migration. Beyond SMS messages, emails, and notifications via MNOs’ mobile
applications targeted at the broad base of 3G subscribers, there were concerted
efforts to reach out to vulnerable groups. For example, M1 and Singtel
called seniors directly, and delivered 4G or 5G SIM cards to the homes
of subscribers with mobility challenges. IMDA supported MNOs in their outreach
efforts by roping in relevant community partners with touchpoints to vulnerable
groups including seniors, and creating awareness of the 3G network retirement.</p>
<p>The MNOs are also offering 3G subscribers 4G and 5G service plans that
do not leave them worse off for at least two years (e.g., no additional
subscription fees and no less favourable service terms). MNOs also support
3G subscribers with phone options such as $0 phones with the purchase of
lowest-cost contract plans, and free upgrades to 4G or 5G SIM cards. Some
MNOs have taken additional steps to support low-income 3G subscribers,
such as providing them with refurbished or new mobile phones.</p>
<p>M1 has fully migrated all its individual and enterprise 3G subscribers
to 4G or 5G services and has started the phased retirement of its 3G network
since 1 August 2024. Singtel and StarHub plan to commence retiring their
3G services from November 2024 to give their remaining 3G subscribers more
time to migrate.</p>
