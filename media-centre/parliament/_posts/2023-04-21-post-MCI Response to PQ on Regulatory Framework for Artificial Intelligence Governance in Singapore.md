### Parliament Sitting on 21 April 2023

QUESTION FOR ORAL ANSWER
------------------------

**19\. Ms He Ting Ru:** To ask the Minister for Communications and Information in view of the proposed regulatory frameworks for artificial intelligence (AI) governance in the European Union and China (a) whether the current approach to AI regulation in Singapore is being reviewed; (b) whether there are any areas in the field that are currently being prioritised for regulation; and (c) what is the anticipated timeline for the introduction of any regulation.

**Answer:** 

1.  Singapore supports the responsible development and deployment of AI, so that its benefits may be enjoyed in a trusted and safe manner.

2.  We have introduced tools to help us achieve these goals. One example is the Model AI Governance Framework. Companies such as DBS, HSBC, Visa, and Microsoft have adopted this framework to address key ethical and governance issues when deploying AI solutions. Another tool is AI Verify, a self-testing framework and toolkit to demonstrate responsible deployment of AI. It has attracted the interest of over 50 companies.

3.  The Personal Data Protection Commission (PDPC) will issue Advisory Guidelines on the Use of Personal Data in AI Systems under the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) within the year.

4.  We engage our industry and international counterparts on AI related issues through our Advisory Council on Ethical Use of AI and Data and the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence.

5.  Similar to how we regulate data use, cybersecurity, misinformation, and online harms, we will continue to review the state of the technology, our regulatory approach, and its effectiveness, in order to uphold trust and safety in digital developments.
