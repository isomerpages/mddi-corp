<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
</p>
<p>The response will also address a similar Parliamentary Question for written
answer raised by Dr Wan Rizal for this sitting.</p>
<p>The Singapore Government takes a serious view on online harms, including
cyberbullying. We have introduced a range of measures and are continuing
efforts to strengthen online safety.</p>
<p>Under the Broadcasting Act, the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA)
has designated six Social Media Services (SMSs) with significant reach
or impact in Singapore. They are Facebook, HardwareZone, Instagram, TikTok,
X (formerly Twitter), and YouTube. These SMSs must comply with the Code
of Practice for Online Safety (Online Safety Code), which took effect on
18 July 2023. They must have additional measures to enhance the online
safety of children, which include: (1) ensuring that children are not targeted
to receive content that SMSs are reasonably aware to be detrimental to
their physical or mental well-being, such as cyberbullying content; (2)
having in place more restrictive account settings for children; and (3)
providing tools for children or their parents to manage their safety.</p>
<p>IMDA closely monitors the designated SMSsâ€™ compliance throughout the year
and will engage them if it detects systemic lapses that impact online safety
for Singapore end-users. Designated SMSs are required to submit annual
reports about measures, systems and processes that they have put in place
to combat harmful content. IMDA is currently reviewing the first set of
reports and will publish the outcome of its review in due course.</p>
<p>These SMSs also have their own community guidelines against harmful content
and provide tools for users to report such content. Singaporeans who encounter
cyberbullying on SMSs should report these incidents. Under the Online Safety
Code, designated SMSs must assess these reports and take appropriate actions
in a timely and diligent manner. If the report is not frivolous or vexatious,
these SMSs must inform the user who submitted the report of their decision
and actions taken.</p>
<p>Where criminal offences are disclosed, acts of cyberbullying may be also
investigated by the Police. These include offences under the Protection
from Harassment Act and the Penal Code, such as distribution of voyeuristic
images or recordings.</p>
<p>Under the Protection from Harassment Act, victims of cyberbullying can
apply for a Protection Order to direct an individual or an entity to take
down published images that cause harassment, alarm or distress. Offenders
who breach the Protection Order would be liable on conviction to a fine
not exceeding $5000, or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months,
or to both.</p>
<p>The Government plans to introduce new legislation and measures to provide
stronger support and assurance to victims of online harms such as cyberbullying.
This will include the setting up of a dedicated agency to help secure timely
relief from perpetrators as well as the social media platforms. More details
will be shared when ready.</p>
