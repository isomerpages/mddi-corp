<h3>Parliament Sitting on 5 February 2024</h3>
<h3>QUESTION FOR WRITTEN ANSWER</h3>
<p><strong>40. Mr Christopher de Souza: </strong>To ask the Minister for
Communications and Information what safeguards and regulations are being
put in place to tackle the issue of deepfake software being used in scam
and fraud cases.</p>
<p><strong>41. Mr Christopher de Souza: </strong>To ask the Minister for
Communications and Information how is the Government helping the public
to better understand artificial intelligence and its capabilities to build
a population grounded in technological understanding so as to combat the
threat of cybercrime and deepfake content.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Artificial intelligence can be exploited for malicious purposes, including
scams and fraud. Agencies such as the Ministry of Communications and Information
(MCI), the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), the Singapore Police Force (SPF),
the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA), and the Cybersecurity
Agency of Singapore (CSA) are working closely to ensure that Singaporeans
can go online safely and safeguard themselves against such online harms
and threats.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Social media platforms are expected to take down scam content as soon
as it is detected, and to take pre-emptive measures to detect and block
possible scams, including deepfake-enabled content. The Online Criminal
Harms Act (OCHA), which was passed in July 2023, allows the Government
to issue directions to online platforms to prevent potential scam related
accounts or content to reach Singapore users. Under OCHA, designated online
service providers may also be required to implement measures (if not already
taken) to proactively disrupt online scams, including those facilitated
by deepfakes.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Government is working with industry partners to strengthen our capabilities
to deal with these threats.&nbsp; Some of these initiatives were recently
addressed in the Parliamentary Motion on Building an Inclusive and Safe
Digital Society. For example, the Centre for Advanced Technologies in Online
Safety (CATOS) which will be launched in the first half of this year, aims
to enhance industry collaboration and knowledge exchanges in deepfakes
detection. The SPF is also working with the Home Team Science and Technology
Agency (HTX) to develop and enhance technologies to detect AI-generated
audio and videos, and respond to the malicious use of deepfake technology.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To complement the Government’s efforts to build a safe and inclusive digital
society, we have rolled out public education programmes on digital media
and information literacy, cybersecurity, and scams. For example, the National
Library Board’s (NLB) signature S.U.R.E. (Source. Understand. Research.
Evaluate.) campaign, the CSA’s national cybersecurity campaign “Unseen
Enemy”, and the SPF/National Crime Prevention Council (NSCPC)’s “I can
ACT against scams”. The Scam Public Education Office (SPEO) was also set
up in 2023 to drive anti-scam public education efforts and expand outreach.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Government will closely monitor and continue to adjust our strategies
and tools to keep pace with the rapidly evolving technological landscape.</p>
</li>
