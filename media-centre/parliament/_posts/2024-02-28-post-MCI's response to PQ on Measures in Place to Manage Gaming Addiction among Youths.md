<p><strong>Answer:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>MCI’s focus is on encouraging healthy gaming habits amongst youths and
ensuring age-appropriate access to online games. To these ends, we have
worked with partners from the people, private and public (3P) sectors to
support parents in guiding their children to navigate the online world
safely and responsibly.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In schools, MOE’s Cyber Wellness education programme equips students with
the knowledge and skills to protect themselves, support their peers and
seek help when faced with issues of excessive internet use and gaming.
The National Library Board’s (NLB) Source, Understand, Research and Evaluate
(S.U.R.E) programme also provides useful resources and tips on positive
online habits and responsible online gaming for parents and youth.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Digital for Life (DfL) portal now provides bite-sized resources including
tips on healthy online gaming habits. MCI, MOE and the Ministry of Social
and Family Development (MSF) are also working on a Parents’ Toolbox to
equip parents with practical strategies to support children’s well-being
and their digital journey. The Toolbox will be launched in phases from
2024.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Beyond these public education initiatives, MCI and IMDA are working to
strengthen our regulatory levers to address concerns over harmful content
on mobile apps, including gaming apps, with the introduction of a new Code
of Practice for App Distribution Services (ADSs). The new Code will require
designated ADSs, which may include Google Play and Apple App Store, to
put in place systems and processes to mitigate users’ exposure to harmful
apps.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gaming addiction, also known as gaming disorder or Internet Gaming Disorder
(IGD), is a medical diagnosis associated with behaviors serious enough
to result in significant impairment in one's personal and social lives.&nbsp;MCI
does not have data on gaming addiction, which requires medical diagnosis.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Parents who suspect that that their child may have IGD should seek help
from their family doctors and public healthcare institutions such as the
National Addiction Management Service (NAMS) for their child to be assessed
on the severity of their condition and determine suitable interventions.
Alternatively, they may approach community partners such as TOUCH Community
Services, which runs counselling and intervention programmes for youths
who may be exposed to excessive gaming and device use.</p>
