<h3>Parliament Sitting on 5 February 2025</h3>
<h3>QUESTION FOR ORAL ANSWER</h3>
<p><strong>*20. Mr Saktiandi Supaat </strong>asked the Minister for Digital
Development and Information (a) whether current regulation of social media
companies includes an ability to review the behind-the-scenes algorithms
that such companies employ to push content to users; and (b) if not, whether
the Ministry will consider that in the next round of strengthening regulations
to mitigate the risks of harmful social media content to Singapore users.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
</p>
<p>Singapore’s approach to online content regulations is outcome-based. We
focus on ways to minimise exposure of harmful online content to Singapore
users, regardless of how the content is generated or how the exposure comes
about. We continue to monitor regulations elsewhere, including Europe and
the United States, that seek to mandate transparency over the algorithms
used by social media platforms. We note that these regulatory approaches
are still in the early stages of development and there is no consensus
on their effectiveness in ensuring online safety.</p>
<p>Under the Code of Practice for Online Safety for social media services,
designated social media services have to ensure that their users have access
to tools on their platforms to manage their own safety, such as tools to
restrict visibility of harmful content and unwanted interactions. The Code
also requires platforms to ensure that children must not be targeted to
receive content that is detrimental to their physical and mental well-being,
and put in place more restrictive account settings. The Code does not prescribe
how the designated social media services are to implement these measures.</p>
<p>To enhance online safety, the Code also mandates that designated social
media services submit annual accountability reports to the Infocomm Media
Development Authority (IMDA). These reports must contain information about
measures that they have put in place to combat harmful content and improve
users’ safety. IMDA is currently reviewing the first annual online safety
reports and will subsequently publish the findings.</p>
<p>We will continue to study the evolving online landscape and review if
additional regulations for social media services are needed, as part of
our ongoing efforts to enhance online safety in Singapore.</p>
