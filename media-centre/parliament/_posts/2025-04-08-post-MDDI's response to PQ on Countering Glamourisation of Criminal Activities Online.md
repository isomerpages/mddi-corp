<h3>Parliament Sitting on 8 April 2025</h3>
<h3>QUESTION FOR WRITTEN ANSWER</h3>
<p><strong>38. Mr Yip Hon Weng </strong>asked the Minister for Digital Development
and Information (a) what targeted strategies has the Ministry considered
to mitigate the glamorisation of criminal activities online, in view of
the rise of the "post-and-boast" culture on social media platforms; and
(b) whether there are plans to collaborate with social media companies
to address this issue.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
</p>
<p>The Government does not condone individuals who post about their criminal
activities on social media and seek to glamourise them. Such acts demonstrate
a lack of accountability for their actions and disregard for victims of
crime.</p>
<p>Under the Code of Practice for Online Safety – Social Media Services (SMSs),
designated SMSs with significant reach or impact (Facebook, HardwareZone,
Instagram, TikTok, X, and YouTube) are required to put in place system-level
measures to minimise Singapore users’ access to harmful content, including
content facilitating vice and organised crime. The designated SMSs’ own
community guidelines prohibit illegal and criminal content on their platforms,
and we expect them to enforce these guidelines. The Government will continue
to work with designated SMSs to ensure that their community guidelines
remain fit-for-purpose and effectively address emerging challenges.</p>
<p>The Police are aware of the ‘post-and-boast’ culture on social media,
and would like to remind members of the public to abide by our laws and
not to participate in acts or viral online trends that constitute a criminal
offence. Those who break the law will be dealt with firmly.</p>
