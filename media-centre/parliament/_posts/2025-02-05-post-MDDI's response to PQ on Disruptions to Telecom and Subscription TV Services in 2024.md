<h3>Parliament Sitting on 5 February 2025</h3>
<h3>QUESTION FOR ORAL ANSWER</h3>
<p><strong>*32. Mr Saktiandi Supaat </strong>asked the Minister for Digital
Development and Information (a) whether the Infocomm Media Development
Authority (IMDA) has concluded its investigations into the disruptions
to mobile, broadband and subscription television services in 2024; (b)
if not, when does the IMDA expect to conclude such investigations and whether
the findings will be made public; and (c) what actions have been taken
against the service operators thus far, in respect of such disruptions.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
</p>
<p>The Infocomm Media Development Authority’s (IMDA) investigations into
the disruptions which occurred in late-2024 are ongoing. Once investigations
are complete, IMDA will publish on its website, the findings of key incidents
including lessons that can be learnt to prevent recurrence. IMDA will also
take firm enforcement action should the investigations reveal lapses on
the part of the service providers. This can include the imposition of financial
penalties and directions to remedy gaps.</p>
<p>For more information on IMDA’s preliminary findings and treatment of the
late-2024 disruptions, Members may refer to Ministry of Digital Development
and Information’s responses to similar Parliamentary Questions at the 11
and 12 November 2024 Parliament Sittings.</p>
