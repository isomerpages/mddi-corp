<h3>Parliament Sitting on 4 February 2025</h3>
<h3>QUESTIONS FOR ORAL ANSWERS</h3>
<p><strong>*13. Mr Mark Lee</strong> asked the Minister for Digital Development
and Information in light of the incident involving unauthorised changes
to residential addresses via ICA’s online system (a) what lessons has the
Government drawn about vulnerabilities in digital public services; (b)
how will this incident impact the Smart Nation strategy; and (c) whether
the Government will commission an independent audit or review of public
sector digital platforms to identify and address cybersecurity gaps.</p>
<p><strong>*14. Mr Yip Hon Weng</strong> asked the Minister for Digital Development
and Information with regard to the recent incidents of fraudulent address
changes through unauthorised Singpass access (a) what are the lessons learnt;
(b) what measures are being implemented to prevent future unauthorised
access of Singpass for address change requests; (c) whether facial verification
will be implemented; (d) if so, how will it incorporate liveness checks
to prevent the use of still photos or other static images; and (e) how
will these checks be designed to counter increasingly sophisticated deepfake
technology.</p>
<p><strong>*15. Dr Tan Wu Meng</strong> asked the Minister for Digital Development
and Information (a) whether there will be a review of all e-Government
services’ vulnerabilities following incidents of unauthorised changes to
residential addresses via ICA's online system; and (b) whether the security
evaluations of all e-Government services will include analysis of potential
exploitation of workflows and processes, in addition to exploits that rely
purely on cyber elements.</p>
<p><strong>*16. Mr Desmond Choo</strong> asked the Minister for Digital Development
and Information regarding the recent incidents of unauthorised changes
to NRIC residential addresses (a) how extensive are the breaches; and (b)
whether the Ministry will be conducting checks on other Government systems
to assess similar vulnerabilities.</p>
<p><strong>*17. Ms Hany Soh</strong> asked the Minister for Digital Development
and Information in respect of ICA’s temporary suspension of its electronic
service for change of residential addresses (a) how does GovTech assist
and support ICA in the implementation of additional security measures;
(b) whether any other private and public agencies are also provided assistance;
and (c) if so, how.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
</p>
<p>My response will also cover the matters raised in the oral question by
Dr Wan Rizal which is scheduled for a subsequent Sitting. If the question
has been addressed, it may not be necessary for the Member to proceed with
the Questions for future Sittings.</p>
<p>Members have raised a range of questions. The Ministry of Home Affairs
has already addressed the queries specific to the electronic Change of
Address (eCOA) service, and how GovTech is supporting on that front. My
reply will address more general questions on other Government digital services
and Singpass, beyond what is relevant to the eCOA service.</p>
<p>Since the unauthorised change of addresses via the Immigration and Checkpoints
Authority’s online system were publicly reported, Government agencies have
been conducting checks on the possible impact to their e-services. So far,
there have been no transactional services identified that can be completed
in the same manner as unauthorised eCOA transactions using only the National
Registration Identity Card (NRIC) number and date of issue of the NRIC.</p>
<p>More broadly, in managing their information technology systems, Government
agencies are required to conduct regular risk assessments, including risks
arising from dependencies on systems managed by other agencies. The systems
must also be regularly assessed for vulnerabilities and subject to penetration
testing. Once identified, vulnerabilities must be promptly remediated.</p>
<p>As for Singpass, GovTech is constantly improving and testing the security
of its design. This includes penetration testing, enhancing fraud analytics,
and requiring additional face verification if Singpass is used for higher
risk transactions.</p>
