<h3>Parliament Sitting on 7 January 2025</h3>
<h3>QUESTION FOR WRITTEN ANSWER</h3>
<p><strong>39. Dr Tan Wu Meng </strong>asked the Minister for Digital Development
and Information (a) what is the rationale for the Government's intention
to stop the practice of partially&nbsp;masking NRIC numbers and why at
the present time; and (b) whether the era of artificial&nbsp;intelligence
and machine learning has accelerated the likelihood of organisations reverse&nbsp;engineering
significant portions of the NRIC database through scraping and collating&nbsp;existing
personal data collections, including lucky draw registrants and customer
lists&nbsp;from the pre-PDPA era.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
</p>
<p>This Parliamentary Question will be addressed through a&nbsp;statement
by the Minister for Digital Development and Information during the Parliament&nbsp;Sitting
on 8 January 2025.&nbsp;</p>
