<h3>Parliament Sitting on 7 January 2025</h3>
<h3>QUESTIONS FOR ORAL ANSWERS</h3>
<p>
<br><strong>*13.</strong>  <strong>Mr Ang Wei Neng </strong>asked the Minister
for Digital Development and Information (a) in the past three years, what
has been the progress of developing more Information and Technology (IT)
and Artificial Intelligence (AI) professionals under the Career Conversion
Programme; and (b) what is the Ministry’s plan in further developing this
in the next three to five years.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
</p>
<p>There are multiple pathways for Singaporeans to acquire relevant skills
for technology-related jobs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These include the more than 1,300 AI-related courses offered by SkillsFuture
Singapore, as well as career conversion programmes supported by Workforce
Singapore, which may also help Singaporeans take up jobs requiring AI-related
skills.</p>
<p>Over the past three years, the Career Conversion Programme (CCP) and the
TechSkills Accelerator (TeSA) have helped more than 1,000 and 8,000 mid-career
workers respectively to transition into technology roles such as software
and cloud professionals, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) engineers.</p>
<p>To strengthen our pipeline from mid-career workers, we are: (i) expanding
the Company-Led Training programme under TeSA to organisations that are
building AI Centres of Excellence; and (ii) topping up SkillsFuture Credits
for Singaporeans aged 40 and above, under the SkillsFuture Level-Up Programme
(SFLP) to support substantive upskilling and reskilling programmes.</p>
<p>These initiatives complement our broader efforts to expand the pipeline
of AI practitioners, including enhancing the AI-readiness of Information
and Digital Technology (IDT) graduates from our Institutes of Higher Learning.
Our industry partners have also initiated programmes to train and hire
AI practitioners, such as AI Singapore’s AI Apprenticeship Programme, SingTel’s
Catalyst Programme and Temus’ Step IT Up Programme.</p>
