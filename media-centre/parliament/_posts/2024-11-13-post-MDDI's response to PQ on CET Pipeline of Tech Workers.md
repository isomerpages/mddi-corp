<h3>Parliament Sitting on 7 January 2025</h3>
<h3>QUESTIONS FOR ORAL ANSWERS</h3>
<p>
<br><strong>*13.</strong>  <strong>Mr Ang Wei Neng </strong>asked the Minister
for Digital Development and Information (a) in the past three years, what
has been the progress of developing more Information and Technology (IT)
and Artificial Intelligence (AI) professionals under the Career Conversion
Programme; and (b) what is the Ministry’s plan in further developing this
in the next three to five years.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
</p>
<p>Mr Speaker, may I have your permission to address PQ 6959 and PQ 7047
scheduled for today’s sitting and PQ 7078 scheduled for tomorrow’s sitting
together.</p>
<p>The stated objective of legislating age limits for social media access
is to protect children and youths from its harms. We share the same objective
and will continue to study the effectiveness of mandating age limits. For
example, how will the authorities assess the extent of violation? Where
will the line be drawn if younger users turn to accessing unregulated platforms
or services? We are engaging our Australian counterparts and social media
platforms to understand their views. This will help inform our thinking
on the next steps.</p>
<p>In the meantime, we have taken several steps to protect our children on
social media. In 2023, we introduced the Code of Practice for Online Safety.
It requires designated social media services to put in place measures to
enhance the safety of Singapore users, including more stringent measures
for children. Among other obligations, they must ensure children are not
targeted to receive content that is detrimental to their physical or mental
well-being. They must also have more restrictive account settings for children
and provide tools for parents to manage their safety.</p>
