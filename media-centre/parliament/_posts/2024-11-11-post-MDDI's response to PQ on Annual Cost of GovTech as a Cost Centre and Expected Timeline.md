<h3>Parliament Sitting on 11 November 2024</h3>
<h3>QUESTION FOR ORAL ANSWER</h3>
<p><strong>*56. Ms He Ting Ru</strong> asked the Prime Minister and Minister
for Finance (a) in the last three years, what is the total annual cost
booked to GovTech as a cost centre; (b) whether there are plans to increase
the revenue-generating capacities of GovTech and its associated departments;
and (c) if so, what are the key milestones and timelines.</p>
<p><strong>Answer (for the Prime Minister)</strong>:</p>
<p>The primary role of GovTech is to harness and develop info-communications
technology solutions and capabilities to drive our Digital Government and
Smart Nation efforts. From Financial Year (FY) 2021 to FY2023, GovTech’s
average annual expenditure was $1.7 billion, which was less than 2% of
total Ministry expenditure.</p>
<p>GovTech is almost fully funded from (i) central grants from the Government
and (ii) other Government agencies paying for the use of GovTech’s services
and products. This is unlikely to change significantly in the near future.</p>
