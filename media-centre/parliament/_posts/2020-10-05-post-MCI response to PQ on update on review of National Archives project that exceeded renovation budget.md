### Parliament Sitting on 5 October 2020

QUESTION FOR WRITTEN ANSWER
---------------------------

**26. Ms Cheng Li Hui:** To ask the Minister for Communications and Information with regard to the Auditor-General's Report detailing that the National Archives project exceeded its renovation budget by $1.72 million due to a lack of scrutiny (a) when is the internal review expected to be completed; and (b) whether the review will also look into ways to strengthen internal financial controls.  

**Answer:**  
  
1. NLB takes a serious view of the lapses identified by the AGO in its 2019/2020 financial year report.  It has since completed its internal review of the lapses and has further tightened its procurement and contract management processes.  Enhancements have been made to the contract variation and project monitoring processes to ensure timely and well-documented approvals for all variation works.  NLB has also taken disciplinary action against the staff involved in these lapses.
