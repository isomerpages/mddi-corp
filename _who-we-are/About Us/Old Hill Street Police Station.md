<p>The Old Hill Street Police Station (OHSPS), was erected in 1934 to house
the Hill Street Police Station and Barracks. It was gazetted as a national
monument in 1998 and transformed into comfortable and lively premises for
the Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts (MICA). MICA moved
from PSA Building to the OHSPS which was renamed as the MICA Building in
2000.</p>
<p>The building was later renamed as the Old Hill Street Police Station again
in 2012, after MICA became the Ministry of Communications and Information
(MCI). With the merger of MCI and Smart Nation and Digital Government Office
(SNDGO) into the Ministry of Digital Development and Information (MDDI),
the OHSPS currently houses MDDI and the Ministry of Culture, Community
and Youth (MCCY).</p>
<h3>Did you know?</h3>
<p>Before the construction of the Old Hill Street Police Station, the Assembly
Rooms - a space for public functions and a building that housed a theatre
and a school - occupied this site from 1845 to 1856. Originally built as
a police station, the building was the largest government building and
regarded as a modern skyscraper at the time of its completion in 1934.</p>
<p>The steep slopes of Fort Canning had to be cut back and shored up, to
provide vehicular access to the back entrance of the building.</p>
<p>The building has a total of 927 windows and they are painted in the colours
of the rainbow. Passers-by will notice that the windows on the first four
storeys have the same vibrant intensity while the colours for the fifth-
and sixth-storey gradually intensify to accentuate the cantilevered balconies
which are interesting architectural features of this historical building.</p>
