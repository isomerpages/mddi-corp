<h4><strong>About the Translation Talent Development Scheme</strong></h4>
<p>The Translation Talent Development Scheme (TTDS) – an initiative by the
National Translation Committee (NTC) under the Ministry of Digital Development
and Information – supports Singaporean translation and interpretation (T&amp;I)
practitioners from the private sector in deepening their skills.</p>
<p>Awarded recipients can receive up to S$10,000 on a reimbursement basis
to upskill. This can be used to offset 90 per cent of the expenses incurred
in their participation of capability development programme(s) related to
translation, interpretation and/or languages in Singapore and overseas.</p>
<h4><strong>TTDS Funding</strong></h4>
<p>The expenses eligible for reimbursement include:</p>
