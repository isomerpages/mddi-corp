Everyone in the community can play their part in strengthening and safeguarding government ICT (information and communications technology) systems, digital services, and data. Members of the public can **report incidents involving any unauthorised disclosure or compromise of government data** on our government data incident reporting platform.

We look forward to working with you to strengthen the overall public sector data security regime.

## What You Can Do to  Help:

✔️ Before making a report, do keep in mind that you should act responsibly when reporting a suspected data incident and safeguarding data from unauthorised use or loss.

✔️ Do conduct yourself in accordance with applicable laws and regulations at all times. **Note:**  Under no circumstances should you attempt to make a false report, publish details of any suspected data incidents involving government data or recklessly or intentionally use government data for wrongful gain.

✔️ Upon detection of a suspected government data incident, notify us as soon as possible by submitting a report to us by filling in the  **[Incident Reporting Form](https://go.gov.sg/DataIncidentForm)**. This will enable the Ministry of Digital Development and Information (MDDI) to conduct an investigation promptly.

✔️ Please provide your **contact details** in the Incident Reporting Form so that you may be reached for clarifications, and for us to provide you with a status update following our investigation.

✔️ Please provide adequate information in the Incident Reporting Form so that we can investigate the suspected data incident thoroughly. It would take **approximately 10 minutes** to complete the form.

✔️ Upon submitting records of evidence to MDDI, please **dispose of all evidence**  immediately in an appropriate manner.
