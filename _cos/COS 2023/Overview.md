Empowering Singaporeans to Thrive in Our Digital Future
-------------------------------------------------------

Digital technologies have become an essential part of our everyday lives. The Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI) is committed to strengthening our digital social compact by keeping people at the core of its efforts.

At the Committee of Supply 2023 debates, MCI outlined our plans to create a safe and inclusive digital society for all Singaporeans. Through the development of our digital infrastructure and providing Singaporeans with access to tools to navigate the digital world, we hope to empower everyone to thrive in our shared digital future.
